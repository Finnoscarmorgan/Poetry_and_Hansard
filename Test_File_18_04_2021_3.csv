59,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2469,0,23/7/03,"KEATING, John",KPE,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,Tasmania,,,0,0,"- I regret in this second discussion of the question to find the leader of the Senate taking the attitude which he is taking. I regret that I do not find myself, as I so often am, in accordwith him. Judging from the way in which he argued yesterday he does not seem to have that sincere conviction of the correctness of his view which he usually entertains when he addresses the Chamber. I had hoped at the outset to be ableto say. that in dealing with the matter on this occasion I could dispense with the argument with reference to what has now been almost worn threadbare, the question of whether a charge or burden on the people is synonymous with a charge or burden on the consolidated revenue. Before dealing even with that I wish to say that I entirely deprecate the attitude which is taken in certain quarters of assuming and also of assuring the public that this discussion is unimportant. I also deprecate the attitude which is assumed by certain persons of attributing to honorable senators who insist upon the right of the Senate to amend this Bill a desire to show hostility towards another place. It is nothing of the kind. A position has been created necessitating our taking one of two courses - either of continuing to maintain that we have the right to amend or of retracing our steps and putting in place of our amendment a request. It is our duty to face that position and to apply ourselves to a solution of the problem which confronts us with a due regard to the principle involved, recognising, of course, that the importance of that principle is not to be measured as some would have us do, by the quality of the legislation in the Bill. I think it is the duty of all honorable senators to come to a decision on the question as to whether the Senate has the right to make an amendment or a request, after a due consideration of all the circumstances, but altogether untrammelled by considerations of what particular policy is embodied in the Bill. I certainly feel a considerable amount of diffidence in taking the course I am taking when I find that the leader of the Senate is supported, and supported so strongly, by the leader of the Opposition. But still I should like to point out that there is one aspect of the question of what is meant by a charge or burden on the people which has not yet, I think, been presented in this Chamber or in the other House. If the argument which has been adopted by those who say that the amendment imposes ""a charge or burden on the people"" be pursued to its logical conclusion, as it was by "

Does it mean so as to increase a charge or burden on the people - any charge, in any circumstances, imposed on the people? No; it refers to a charge or burden on the people thenproposed. "
62,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2470,0,23/7/03,"O'CONNOR, Richard",JYD,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,,,,0,0,  - what is proposed in the Bill as It comes up to the Senate.
63,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2470,0,23/7/03,"KEATING, John",KPE,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,,,,0,0,"- That is so. It must not be taken, therefore, to apply to an increase of burdens or charges on the people generally, whether present or prospective. It must be taken to apply to a case of a burden or charge that is being proposed at the particular time. In connexion with this we see that in the first instance taxation is the imposition of a charge or burden on the people, and I contend that in that sense this appropriation cannot be held to be a charge or burden on the people. The proceeds of taxation form revenue. If that revenue is in any way appropriated, if the requirements of the Crown necessitate drawing upon that revenue, can it be said that that involves an additional charge or burden on the people? When, for instance, a charge or burden on the people to the extent of £100,000 has been imposed by taxation, when the amount has been collected we say that a burden orcharge has been imposed on the people to the extent of £100,000. If, subsequently, £80,000 of that sum is appropriated, can it be said that that £80,000 appropriation is also a charge or burden on the people ? If so, we should have a total charge or burden on the people to the extent of £180,000, and only £100,000 of money affected. It cannot be a charge or burden on the people when first collected and also when afterwards appropriated. If that were held to be a correct reading, when the whole of the £100,000 was expended there would have been a charge or burden on the people of double the amount, according to those who contend that in this instance we should make a request and not an amendment. The people, although they would only have paid £100,000, would, when that sum had been appropriated, have sustained a charge or burden of £200,000. The section, therefore, can only apply to a charge or burden proposed at the particular time - "

66,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2470,0,23/7/03,"KEATING, John",KPE,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,,,,0,0,"Then we have several other sections dealing with incidental matters until we come to section 51 of the Constitution, the one which contains what are commonly known as "" the 39 articles."" That defines, to some extent, the jurisdiction of the Parliament. Honorable senators will bear in mind that up to that section there is not - the slightest distinction drawn in the Constitution between the powers of the Senate and those of the House 'of Representatives. Later om we come to section 69, and we find under the heading "" Executive Government "" that certain departments of State are to be transferred, and inferentially Parliament is to have the power of  legislation  in connexion with them. So far we have not the slightest suggestion of any difference whatever in the powers of the two Houses. On the contrary, under section 49 each is to have the powers of the British Commons at the date of the establishment of the Commonwealth. The limitation comes in this particular section 53. Honorable, senators will bear in mind that, apart from this section 53, there is no limitation whatever in the powers of the Senate, and it is both coequal and co-ordinate in its legislative functions with the House of Representa- tives. Now we come to this principle that being a limitation of the powers of one Chamber which otherwise is co-equal with the other Chamber - according to all rules of construction of statutes, this section must be construed most strictly, and in favour of the particular body whose rights are being limited. Unless the limitation is clear, precise, and definite, it cannot apply. That is the ordinary rule of construction with regard to legislation limiting the rights of any body or any individual. So that if at any time there should appear to be any doubt--anc I am not saying that I am entertaining any doubt in. this instance - whether or not the operation of this section covers certain work of the Senate, it must be construed in favour of the Senate, because this is a section of limitation. I pointed out in dealing with this matter on a previous occasion th,e significance of the words "" so as to "" in this paragraph (3) of section 53. The paragraph says - "

68,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2470,0,23/7/03,"KEATING, John",KPE,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,,,,0,0,"In considering these words strictly, I contend that the words ""so as to"" have to be given the fullest significance in favour of this Chamber. They are not to be construed as equal to the expressions "" likely to be,"" "" calculated to have the effect,"" or anything of that kind. They must be construed absolutely strictly, and it must be patent that the amendment proposed is an amendment of such a character that its direct, immediate, and inevitable effect will be to increase some then proposed charge or burden on the people. I do not admit that there is ""a proposed charge or burden in this case, but I am assuming, for the sake of argument, that there is. The effect of these words, ""so as to,"" upon a strict construction, necessitates that the amendment shall be of such a character .that in the words of lawyers, "

72,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2473,0,23/7/03,"KEATING, John",KPE,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,,,,0,0,"- That has been the tendency displayed, and the honorable senator, on reference to the debates in the Seriate and in the other Chamber, will see that arguments have been based on the powers of the Senate as defined by section 53, ignoring the fact that that section is not the grant, but the limitation of those powers. That is a fallacy which has led some honorable senators into considering what is provided under the Constitution, from an entirely wrong point of view. They have viewed section 53 in an entirely different way from that in which they should have viewed it, and they have omitted to consider the rest of the Constitution. It is the section which confers legislative power upon the Senate and the other House, the section which defines the powers of the Houses, the particular section which defines the limits of jurisdiction of the Parliament, and the other section which refers to transferred departments in connexion with which inferentially we have the power to legislate - as is these particular sections which confer the powers of the Senate, and section 53 is simply introduced as a section to limit those powers in certain circumstances to a certain extent. Why were . the Senate's powers limited in regard to money matters ? Was it because the Senate is unrepresentative of the people as is the House of Lords? Was it because we do not properly represent the people as in the case of the nominee Canadian Senate, or in a lesser degree certain Legislative Councils in some of the self-governing British possessions? We know that although originally the financial preponderance of the House of Commons arose out of the insistent demands of the people that their representatives, and their representatives only, should hold the purse-strings, during the course of the last century it has been found that the financial preponderance of one House makes for the stability and permanence of the cabinet system of government ; because it has been considered that if the two Houses had co-equal powers, it would then be a matter almost of impossibility, in many instances, that the Cabinet should maintain simultaneous majorities in both Houses. Although the original reason for the establishment of the difference in the powers of the two British Houses was the unrepresentative character of one as compared with the other, still a great reason why it has been maintained in Constitutions where two Chambers are representatives of the people is because it has now come to be considered a necessary adjunct of responsible government. This leads us to consider how far effect has been given to that principle in section 53. The Cabinet system of government could not be carried on if the Cabinet had a majority in one House, and if the other House refused to vote the ordinary supplies they required for the year, or if their policy of taxation was approved in one Chamber and thrown out by the other. But going beyond those two classes of cases equal powers, especially in the case of two Chambers which are representative, will not be inimical to the maintenance of responsible government. Consequently we find in sec tion 53 that this Senate has no power to originate or amend the  ordinary  annual Appropriation Bill or Bills imposing taxation. These are practically the two matters upon which it is absolutely essentia] a Cabinet Government shall have a majority behind them if they are to remain in office. But what -of this Bill now before us "

Supposing the Government anticipated that under the original proposal £60,000 would be required, and that even if the amendment were carried, only £40,000 was needed ; should we then be taken to have increased the appropriation requisite for carrying out the policy ? "

80,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2474,0,23/7/03,"KEATING, John",KPE,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,,,,0,0,"  - It is the way suggested by the interjections of senators Higgs and Pulsford, and by all the arguments from the other side, which are based wholly on probabilities. If the amount that the Government require to have appropriated for this purpose were definitely set down in the Bill, and we proposed to enlarge that amount, we should be directly increasing the appropriation, the charge or burden on the revenue or on the people, according as honorable senators may choose to term it. but there is no definite appropriation set down in the Bill."

88,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2474,0,23/7/03,"KEATING, John",KPE,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,,,,0,0,"- There is no appropriation of a definite sum. If there had been, and wen had proposed to appropriate a larger sum, we should certainly then be amending a law so as to increase the appropriation, or increase the charge or burden on the people or on the revenue, according as we might 'view it. In the absence of any definite sum proposed, and construing this section strictly, we must not have regard to the "" may be "" or "" might be,"" or any of the possibilities, but to what we know to be the immediate effects as shown by the amendment itself. The amendment must be of such a character and quality that its immediate and direct effect, apart from any intervening circumstances, will be to increase the proposed charge or burden! on the people. I therefore intend to adhere to the attitude I held when this matter was previously before us - first, because I do not consider this amendment to involve a charge or burden on the people within the meaning of section 53. Again, even if this were allowed to be a charge or burden on the people, I contend that "

I remember very well that at the time of the Federal elections, there were none more eloquent or more consistent than the Prime Minister and the Vice-President of the Executive Council in claiming that New South Wales, at any rate, should return only men who would maintain the Constitution.

If. they are the moneys of the people we cannot be creating a fresh burden on the people by merely  distributing  them. I wish to refer to the question of whether the distribution of the money involves an increase of the burden on the people from another stand-point, and that is what the people may be called upon to pay.

153,23/7/03,1,2,0,SENATE,2482,0,23/7/03,"PULSFORD, Edward",K1U,SUGAR BONUS BILL,bill,New South Wales,,,0,0,"- I shall support the proposal of the Government, which indicates the proper course to be followed by the Senate. It is singular that, whilst honorable members of another place are united in their views on this question, senators are about ""six of the one and half-a-dozen of the other."" That is a very unfortunate position, which should be considered by those who wish to precipitate a conflict between the Houses. I cannot help observing that the two honorable senators, who are perhaps the warmest on this subject, are our military friends, Senators Gould and Neild. I suppose those honorable senators are so accustomed to the idea, if not the practice, of fighting, that they feel called upon to infuse a little military ardour even into their arguments. It has always appeared to me that the Constitution conferred upon the Senate rather greater powers than the Convention intended. The Convention decided that there should be some distinction made between the two Houses in regard to the way in which Money Bills were to be dealt with, and then the Convention proceeded to so arrange matters that the distinction was practically lost. It was as though we were expected to send down to the other House a statement of our wishes in a blue envelope instead of in a white envelope - that we were to send our proposals down and call them "" requests "" instead of calling them "" amendments."" I do not see that the rose smells less sweet if called by any other name. To my mind the power remains with us, and we are in no danger of losing it. If we have not the straightout power of amendment in certain Bills, we have always the power of making requests, and surely that power rightly and properly used is sufficient, and is in no danger of being lost. I feel strongly that the dignity and position of this Chamber is best conserved by recognising the spirit of the Convention and of the Constitution. In my view, the Constitution calls on us to make our wishes known in a form which accords with the popular view as recognised in the Convention, and represented by the House of Representatives. If at any time a difference of opinion arises between the two Houses, and there is any uncertainty, I shall feel it my duty to unhesitatingly give the benefit of the doubt to the House of Representatives. In following that course, I shall feel that I am adopting the course which best promotes the dignity of this Chamber, and which will increase our strength for the time, if ever it comes, when we have to fight over some question of substantial importance. When the rights or privileges of the Senate are at stake, no one will be found fighting for them more strongly than myself. "

So far as we know, it has no objection to the original proposition, except that it was made in a wrong form. If the Ministry are prepared to accept a modification - and we understand that they are - when it comes before us it can be considered, and probably we shall then have the assistance of a number of honorable senators who were not prepared to go the whole length with us, but who might go to the limit which is now suggested by "

I feel that I was justified in trying to find out whether my proposal would be likely to be accepted by the Government, or by a majority in the other House. Let us see what the modification I propose amounts to. The original proposal of the Government was that all cane planted by black labour prior to 28th February last should be excluded from the bounty. There were 90,000 acres under cane, and only those cultivating 36,000 acres would be able to secure the bounty under the original proposal. I felt that many of those who desire to do away with black labour in the cultivation of sugar-cane would be unable to secure the bounty, and that the fulfilment of the policy of a white Australia would thus be retarded. I moved an amendment upon the original proposal of the Government, which was subsequently carried in the Senate, to enable a number of planters who had already been working their plantations for twelve months with white labour, to secure the bounty. I now find that "

After all there is nothing new in putting these considerations before the Senate. This is what we do in every case in which we wish to come to an agreement with the other House. We do not propose an amendment or make a request here which will suit our own views only. We do that in the first instance, but when we see what are the views of the other House, we propose our request or amendment in a form which we think will be acceptable to the other House. That is the course which is being suggested here. If my honorable friends, the senators representing Queensland, are willing to adopt this course in the interest of the Queensland planters, they will have this advantage, that the modified proposal will be taken up and supported by the Government, and although I cannot, any more than any one else, guarantee that it will be carried, I have very little doubt that it will, and that the Bill will become law at once and all uncertainty will be removed from the minds of those persons who have been kept in suspense in connexion with this measure for so long.
