9,1902-04-23,1,1,0,SENATE,11888,0,1902-04-23,"SYMON, Josiah",K7V,PAPERS,papers,South Australia,,,0,0,"- It seems to me. a perfectly reasonable arrangement which the VicePresident of the Executive Council proposes, because we all know that the speech with whichhe will support his motion for the second reading of the Bill will really be a second or revised Budget speech, bringing up the revenue receipts adjusted with reference to theTariff - the improved Tariff, I may say - as it comes from the House of Representatives. The new material and the new figures, to which he has referred, will all be essential. Of course it was impossible to expect any one either to have themready or to have them mastered in the short time which has been available.. . "

Ordinarily we should not have the speech in, print until the following Monday week, but I have no doubt that he will take care so to arrange, as was done on a former occasion - I think in connexion with the Electoral Bill - that his speech, which, of course, will be all important for our consideration, shall be available to us as part of this week's "

I need not say a word in reference to the absolute necessity for our having the report of the speech in our possession. Any papers or figures to which my honorable and learned friend may refer in the course of his speech - including those which have been already laid before the House of Representatives, and, no doubt, have been in our possession for some months, but which are not readily available - might be furnished to us again if it can be done without inconvenience or expense. It would save a great deal of time. I arn sure that we all desire, as far as possible, consistently with our public duty, to expedite the progress of this important measure. "

I hope that no proposal will be made to adjourn the Senate until next Thursday week. It was a kind of unwritten understanding that when the Tariff came up the Senate should meet on Tuesday, but now honorable senators are to be brought from Adelaide, Tasmania, and Sydney simply to sit on Thursday, and on Friday until 4- o'clock. We are beginning in a very bad way indeed to save time. It will put me to inconvenience to be kept here very much longer. I hope we shall not lose a single day next week. "

34,1902-04-23,1,1,0,SENATE,11889,0,1902-04-23,"STEWART, James",K7D,PAPERS,papers,,,,0,0,"- If we have not, then we ought to have been doing so. It is our duty as public men not only to look after the business of the Senate, but to- keep a very keen eye on what is being done in the other Chamber. Probably I do not know quite so much about these subjects as some honorable senators do, and therefore, for my own information, I have been compelled to follow the debates in the other House so as to prepare myself for the passage of the Tariff through this Chamber. That being the case, and seeing that we have been sitting here for about twelve months, the Tariff should be passed through the Senate as speedily as possible. I will not say that it should be passed in a hurry ; neither do I want to have any undue delay. But why should there be a proposal to adjourn till Thursday of next week "

In addition to those which have already been stated, I may add that as far as I am personally concerned, it will he necessary for me to devote all the time between now and Friday to the preparation of the matter which I deem it my duty 'to put before the Senate in moving the second reading of the Bill.

The whole of the business appearing on the paper in the names of private members is of some importance. There is the question of assurance against accident, the question of old-age pensions - which is a very live question in all the States - and my own notice ofmotion dealing with the tobacco monopoly. These are all matters of interest to the country. It seems to me that no later opportunity will arise to discuss these questions. Those honorable senators who have come over from South Australia and New SouthWales will be here for the rest of the week. Why drop one sitting day when there is business to be disposed of ? If I had thought we were not to have an opportunity of discussing private members' motions, I should not have put one on the paper. I put it there in the belief that the Senate would give me the first opportunity that arose of dealing with the matter. There is no reason why we should not meet to-morrow. The Vice-President of the Executive. Council need not be here. The Postmaster-General can represent the Government on the questions affected. "

I am prepared to go on with the  notice  of motion standing in my name. I have been at considerable trouble to collect material which is well worthy of the consideration of the Senate, and I should like the Government to give me an opportunity of discussing it. "
