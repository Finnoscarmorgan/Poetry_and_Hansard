The recent elections, which were held during the course of the greatest war in history, have created a situation indicative of the arrival of a new political era. It would be difficult to analyse the motives of the people in voting  as  they did. Some factors stand out clearly and one of these is that issues viewed by all parties as being important have been completely disregarded in making the choice' of governors for the next three years. If we give him the role of an elector, we may acquire enlightenment from the Persian poet-philosopher who, first, to record his bewilderment, wrote -  "" Myself..... did eagerly frequent "

- It would appear that the die is cast but I would like to make my final comment on this matter. In my opinion the effort of the Opposition to reduce the cost of this scheme is taking place in the wrong field. When the superannuation scheme was introduced emphasis was placed on the optional position in relation to retirement at 60 or 65 years of age. It was at that time evidently thought that this option should be given. Some 50 years later when we are working at an all-time high level of pressure and when people desire a longer retirement than was desired previously, a move now is taking place whereby the relief from the overall expenditure, which I think has some merit, is taking place in the wrong field. I will be presumptious enough to be somewhat biblically poetic and to say: 
 
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be four-score years. 
 
It would appear that there is a necessity for people in the last 20 years of their normal life span to be able to live in retirement with a security for which they have justly paid. 
 
I would have far preferred to have seen not such a liberal arrangement in connection with contributions than to take away what I maintain is a necessary component of any superannuation or insurance scheme. As I see it, we must endeavour to retain equity between the subscribers. In all the hundreds of representations that have been made to me by organisations and individuals not only by correspondence but also verbally, it would appear that the main concern is that retirement at 60 years of age should remain in this Bill. Those people are part of an agreement. It is an agreement between 2 parties each of which has his rights because each is subscribing to it. In view of that I think we should take cognisance of what those people have had to say in this connection. The scheme is a generous one. I do not think there is any doubt about that. I think it needs to be a generous scheme. Any pruning of it should not take place in the field that is now proposed in this amendment. Therefore on this particular amendment I intend to vote with the Government. "

                 -As Senator Durack says, he tried to explain that he understood it 10 years ago, but in trying to explain what he understood 10 years ago he devoted much of his time to telling us that national trusts existed in the various States in those days and that he was interested in some of the issues which they pursued at that time. He said that he knew of other people who were interested, and so on. That was not the point. We all know that what he said is perfectly true. We all know that the national trusts have been active in Australia for a long time, and their activities are to be applauded. But we all know they were starved of funds, that they were singularly unsuccessful in carrying out their activities and that they were crying poverty all the time because of the utter disinterest of government and the utter failure of government to appreciate what they were all about. 
 
This legislation is part of the broad thrust of the Government's program which has been expressed in many ways- in terms of conservation policy, in terms of a new approach to Australia's national identity, and in terms of preservation in all respects of things that are unique in our landscape, history and culture. It is consistent with the program that the Government has adopted for the arts, which was the subject of some criticism a year or two ago. It is consistent with the National Gallery legislation which will be brought before the Senate soon. It is consistent with a new approach to foreign policy and it is even consistent, although in a much more minor way, with the new system of honours that has been introduced in this country. All of these things are a recognition of the unique nature of this country, of its own identity, and of its growing maturity as a nation. Even in a small way one could refer also to another piece of legislation passed by this Parliament recently, namely, the Glebe Lands Appropriation BUI. The point I make in referring to these things is that none of them happened in Australia at a national level before December 1972, and that is nowhere better recognised than in the report of the Hope Commission itself, where it stated that recognition quite explicitly in these words: 
 
The Australian Government has inherited a national estate which has been downgraded, disregarded and neglected. All previous priorities accepted at various levels of government and authority have been directed by a concept that uncontrolled development, economic growth and progress', and the encouragement of private as against public interest in land use, use of waters, and, indeed, in every part ofthe National Estate, was paramount. 
 
That is what the Government inherited in December 1972. Is it not true that, if one looks back to the years before December 1972 to the Australian national heritage, one finds that the music that one heard was the music of the cash registers of mining companies? The poetry was the poetry of motion on the share market and nowhere else. That was because none of these things was heard about as subjects for national debate, national political debate, in those years, and I have only to remind the Senate of the great voices of those years, the great voices of people like Jock Marshall, Robyn Boyd, Judith Wright and various other people of that kind. They were voices crying in the wilderness in Australia about the very things that this legislation is about. That is why I say that it is important that we recognise that this piece of legislation represents part of the broad thrust of the Government's program and is a great change in attitude towards these problems, because prior to this Government there was a very depressed spirit abroad about these types of problems in Australia, and the cultural symbol of this country was usually considered to be nothing more than the meat pie. 
 
As I have said,  Senator Durack  has gone to great lengths to say: 'Look, we really thought of this, but we did not do anything about it. We were sort of working on it and that kind of thing, in Western Australia, and it is not the Government's idea.'  His  whole speech reminded me of somebody who had been caught stealing clothes and who said: 'Really, I am only borrowing them'. That is the broad thrust of the Opposition 's approach in this debate. 
 
The only other point I wanted to make in that regard was that this Government acted very quickly. In May 1973 the Hope Committee was appointed. Last year it produced a magnificent report which has been the subject of much discussion in the Australian community. I want to say a brief word about the personnel of the Interim Committee on the National Estatepeople such as  Mr David  Yencken, a man who as interim  chairman  has shown himself to be a person of great wisdom, experience and enthusiasm in trying to see that future generations of Australians enjoy the heritage which only a few years ago was being swept away by our obsession with growth in terms of growth of the economy, growth of cities and so on; and Judith Wright, who for many years was once a voice crying in the wilderness but who is now a voice of significance in the community on this issue because of this legislation and because ofthe establishment of the Interim Committee. 
 
I agree with  Senator Durack  that the world will not change overnight because of the passing of this Bill by the Senate. Nothing very dramatic will happen. I believe it is symbolic legislation in a way, in that it is a recognition by the Parliament of a change in community attitudes and in government attitudes to this very important problem. All of us have various views about the significance of our relationship, as members of the human species, with our environment. It is a subject which we do not debate perhaps enough. I believe this legislation is a recognition that our values on this matter have not been subject to the scrutiny which they ought to have received in the past. From now on, with this legislation and the other legislation to which I have referred as a basis, we can proceed in this country with guidelines which will provide perhaps a better environment for future generations of Australians than that which has existed in the past.

While the Government does not agree with a number of the proposals contained in the report by the Distribution Commissioners for New South Wales, it has no doubt whatsoever that they have performed a most exacting task with competence, dedication and integrity. The Government proposes that the name of Gilmore be substituted for Eastwood, Evatt for Toongabbie, and Evans for Concord. Evatt is to honour the Right Honourable H. V. Evatt, eminent Australian, judge, statesman and scholar. Gilmore is to be named after Dame Mary Gilmore, poet, author, schoolteacher, journalist, wife and mother, who during her later years achieved unique status as a public figure who was listened to with respect on any subject simply because she was Mary Gilmore- a great person. It is most appropriate in International Women's Year to honour her as a great Australian. I urge the Senate to approve the motion for the redistribution of the State of New South Wales into electoral divisions. 
 
The latest enrolment figures available for all divisions as at 25 April 1975 in New South Wales as provided by the Chief Australian Electoral Officer are as follows:

Its first aim was to enable publishers to reduce the retail price of Australian works of fiction and poetry as well as non-fiction titles of literary merit It also had the aim of allowing publishers to offer more generous terms to booksellers and to keep books in print for longer periods. 
 
After the scheme had been in operation for twelve months, the Board produced a list of about ninety books which had been or were about to be published under the terms of the new program. The list included thirty-six works of fiction and thirty-six books of poetry. 
 
These figures indicate a considerable increase in the publication of works of this kind in comparison with previous years. 
 
The principal aim of the scheme is not to assist publishing houses directly but to aid the general promotion of Australian literature by making more works by Australian authors available to a wider readership. Nevertheless, it is obvious that the Australian publishing industry must benefit at least indirectly from such a scheme. Among the thirty-one publishing houses which received assistance in the first year of the program were a number of small firms with limited resources. They included, for example, Alpha Books, the Australasian Book Society, Contempa Publications, Cypress Books, Edwards and Shaw, Island Press, Outback Press, Wentworth Books, Whole Australian Catalogue Publications and Wild and Woolley. 
 
Although the scheme is not specifically designed to increase employment possibilities within the Australian publishing industry it will be obvious by what has been said that one of its incidental effects must be to increase those possibilities. 
 
The program is still in its infancy and is subject to constant assessment and revaluation by the Literature Board, in consultation with publishers, but the Government has good reason to be confident that it will reduce the disadvantages of the publishing industry. "

Firstly, as the superannuation scheme is described as being the only one of its kind in the world, can the Minister give me some further information on qualifications for eligibility in this superannuation scheme, particularly qualifications relating to age and contributions required. Secondly, in relation to the announcement concerning arts grants, does the Government really believe that a grant to a troupe of poets and dancers to perform in Sydney streets and parks reflects the Governments 's recent pleas for restraint?

-  I listened with a great deal of interest to  Senator Carrick.  As he spoke my mind wandered to the words of the poet Bracken who once wrote:  The poison shafts of falsehood and derision Are oft impaled against those who mould the age. 
 
As  Senator Georges  said when he was called upon to explain why he was interjecting, 
 
Carrick suggested that we should be prepared to debate with him or other Government speakers matters relating to health, unemployment, taxation, social services and the wide spectrum of affairs with which he dealt. When those debates come on in this chamber we will gladly attack the Government on those measures as we will attack it on the Budget. 
 
I read with tremendous interest the Budget Speech of the Treasurer  (Mr Snedden).  It is probably the most vital budget that has been introduced by a Liberal Treasurer for many years. It is vital because it is a do or die effort by the Government. Gallup polls have been running against the Government for months. Public criticism is at the highest level it has ever been. As the Government pulled a rabbit out of the hat in  1954  with the Petrov inquiry, it hopes that the rabbit out of the hat on this occasion will be the Budget. It is the second budget that has been introduced by the present Treasurer. The first was introduced in August last year. That Budget was a complete catastrophe for the Government and a disaster for the nation. It set out to curb inflation. All it did was create greater inflation and serious unemployment. I well recall that when it was introduced in August last year both the Federal leader of the Australian Labor Party,

- It is not a matter of any importance whatever to-day. ' I am long past the age when that particular consideration could interest  me.
 
We are discussing this motion, I trust, without party or personal feeling. I am reluctant to curtail the privileges of honorable senators in what is known as a chamber of review. There is something in the contention that the privileges of debate have not been generally abused by members of the .Senate; but I am in favour of some reasonable limitation of debate, not because I believe that "" stonewalling"" may not occasionally have its merits, but because I am of the opinion that no one individual should be permitted to so misuse the privileges of de-, bate as to take away the opportunities of other honorable senators who may desire to participate in discussions. It follows, though - and logically - that if we once impose a limit upon the speech of an honorable senator, the  very fact of that imposition gives him the right to speak. In a chamber of review, such as this, the adoption of a standing order of this character is inconsistent and incompatible with what is known as the application of the closure, . or the "" gag."" I am not in favour of having both. There are certain formal motions which should always be put and agreed to without debate; and there are certain questions which are mentioned in standing order No. ' 431, which are really of a machinery character. They provide for certain motions to be put to the Senate,- and, if necessary, to the vote, without debate. I am confident that no honorable -senator can be of opinion that Standing order No. 431, which involves the application of the ""gag,"" is wrong. But, in regard to general debate upon measures and motions, if we are going to have a time limit, then every honorable senator possesses the inherent right' to say, ""You shall hear me. You shall not apply the  gag '."" While it is essentially necessary that there shall be a time limit to speeches, the time limit in this Chamber is incompatible with the use of the closure in regard to measures necessitating general debate. I am not one of those who subscribe to the cheap and rash assertion that a man should be  able  to say in an hour all that is necessary to be said upon ' any -particular subject. There are men who could discuss points of constitutional law and history, and to whom I would be pleased to listen for hours on end. There are proposals to amend the Constitution, and I believe speeches of more than an hour's duration may be necessitated by the principles involved in the amendments foreshadowed. I subscribe to the belief that "" stone-walling,"" in some instances, may 'be necessary. We have heard of the speeches of ex-Senator Neild; we have also listened to long discourses by ex-Senator Story, and other lengthy deliverances, of which we have had occasion to complain. Let me inform honorable senators that the records disclose that the longest parliamentary speech was made in the ""United States of Colombia, in South America, where a member spoke for thirty hours, and at the end was in a state of physical exhaustion. But why did he speak? Because the House was on the point of being dissolved. According to the practice in that country, the  President  would come down on a certain day, and at a certain hour dissolve the House. On that occasion, had a certain measure, which was .then before the Chamber, been passed, the whole of the people in the United States of Colombia who were closely associated with 'the pastoral industry .would have been absolutely ruined. The debate was continued until the hour when the  President  was to dissolve the Parliament arrived, and a single member was triumphant. It is said that at the close of his speech .his tongue was glued to the roof of his mouth, his lips were black, and his face distorted. But the  speaker  was triumphant, and the people, at a succeeding election, held him to be completely 'justified. On occasions "" stone-walling "" may be necessary, beneficial, and completely compatible with outside opinion. But Parliament must transact its business ; and I must admit that the case I have instanced was .an exceptional one. I do not believe that measures should be rushed through .Parliament. We are told that there is much waste of time, and that :a good many people claim that we do not pass measures quickly enough. .Parliament was not designed, nor was it intended to be, a particularly speedy institution. It has traditions, and has had to contend against Kings, Ministers, corrupt courtiers, and corrupt Judiciaries; -and, naturally, very reluctantly passes measures that give privileges to Governments. Some contend that a man should say everything he desires in a, few minutes. But who would say because Shakespeare could write a sonnet which will live for ever, that Hamlet could be compressed into one or two acts ? Would any one say because the argument preceding each book of  Paradise Lost  is stated in a few lines, that Milton's great poem is redundant, and not worth reading ?

- I re-echo that sentiment. I remind some honorable senators, also, that the present generation / Australians suffered nothing to win th, freedom that we have always enjoyed in this country. The sufferings of the past were borne by our grandfathers, both within and without the Empire. I have heard some midget-minded men suggest that the present generation of Australians are men of superior clay; as people who live on the mountain tops, while we who coane from other parts of the world are living on the plains beneath. I say to men who endeavour to differentiate between those who, by accident of birth, have been launched upon the sea of events in Australia, and other members of this community, that they are all the time reflecting on the parents who begat them. When they tell us that the present generation of Australians are men of superior stamp, and that nothing else matters except what, they think and what they say or do, I reply that there are. other people who did infinitely more for the prosperity of this country than they have done individually. 
 
So much by the way. Let me return to the consideration- of the Peace Treaty on a cash basis. I repeat that because it has been obtained cheaply by too large a section of this country, it is not valued at its true worth. I notice, according to a statement by the Prime Minister  (Mr. Hughes)  that the cost of the war to Australia is something like £400,000,000, including the cost of repatriation capitalized. Roughly speaking, that means a debt of £80 per head of our population. That appears to be a huge burden for a handful of people to bear; but it is only a flea-bite in comparison with what this country would have had to shoulder had the tide of battle turned against us, and had this Treaty been dictated from Berlin instead of from Versailles, and a Hindenburg in the chair instead of a Clemenceau.  If this document had reached us from Berlin, where would some of these men who have opposed Australia's sturdy war policy have been? They would then have had substantial reasons to complain if, instead of continuing to live under the free institutions which have been preserved to us by the men who shed their blood, and let it flow in the common stream, they had been brought under the heel of a German conqueror. Complaint ill-becomes those who, in this country, have resorted to glorification of their own past methods, which, if they had been followed by those in control of Australia's policy, would have paralyzed the war efforts of this country, and, to that extent, of the Allies. I have often wished that, as a measure of retributive and poetic justice, those who sought to paralyze the nation's arm in this great struggle - some of them outside, and some of them inside this Parliament- - could have been placed upon a desert island. And I have wished that a Ludendorff, or a von Bissing. or a Liman von Sanders, could have been placed in charge of them, with a forest of rusty bayonets behind them. They would have felt then what it meant to exist under conditions where they could no longer do as they pleased, but would be made to do this and that, with a rusty bayonet behind them. "

- With all due respect to my honorable friends I make the statement. This Parliament is too highminded to go behind the spirit and meaning of a resolution which it affirms. There is much in French civilization, and in the French character which claims the admiration of mankind. 
 
It must surely be humiliating to a Frenchman to reflect that hi6 country cannot now be regarded as safe unless guaranteed by the other great Powers. I say to the French, notwithstanding my admiration for them, that it is their own fault that that is so. I am friendly to France and to the French people, and it is lamentable that I should have to say from my place here that, had French men and French women been true to themselves in, every respect; had. they acknowledged what was due to their race, they would not now have to get the guarantees of other nations to protect them against Germany. The Leader of the Opposition  (Senator Gardiner)  referred to the fact that Germany has. a population of 80,000,000 or 90,000,000, while France, we understand, has had her population reduced by the war from 38,000,000 to 34,000,000. In Napoleon's day the French numbered over 30,000,000, and he, speaking of his struggle with the British Empire, said, "" Thirty millions of Frenchmen against 15,000,000 of British ! The result cannot be doubtful. History will repeat itself. Rome will destroy Carthage."" But Rome, by which he meant France, did not destroy Carthage the second time. Fortunatelv both Rome and Carthage, using his terms for France and England, survive to-day, and are now joining hand in hand to secure the liberties of mankind and their perpetuation. The point I wish to make now, however, is that, while at the time of the Napoleonic wars the population of Britain numbered only 15,000,000, it now numbers nearly 50,000,000; and France, whose population then was 30,000,000, has now only 34,000,000. In Napoleon's day, there were 22,000,000 Germans, and now there are 80,000,000 or 90,000,000 Germans. It is because of the French disregard of the principles that make nations great that France hae been humiliated by having to seek the protection of other countries against Germany. Millions of unborn Frenchmen should now be inhabiting the tabernacles of the flesh. They should be helping us to fill the waste spaces of Australia, where they would be welcome. The French are too few in number. Their language is losing ground before that of the British. I say to them in the verse of one of their own poets - "

That is noble sentiment; and, after all our trials and sacrifices, I want to know whether the result is to bring some light and comfort into the cottage home-^-is to bring about better conditions for the masses of the people.

Perhaps I limited myself a little too much in my second -reading speech, but during the fifteen years I have been in the Senate I never remember making a statement which I have had to withdraw. Statements concerning deposits on the island vary so much that I am reluctant to repeat them. One expert has said that there is sufficient phosphatic rock there to supply the whole world for a hundred years. He talks like a poet, and I am not prepared to accept his figures. I have carefully searched for definite statistics, but, so far, have not found a reliable authority apart from officials of the company, who have, no doubt, prepared figures in their own interests. I do not desire to reflect upon them, but I am not prepared to accept their view as the last word on this point. "

. - As more than six months have elapsed since Parliament last met, and as many international and Australian events of importance have transpired during that time, it is quite natural that members of the Senate should feel inclined to unburden themselves of some opinions with regard to"" those events, more particularly as at the present moment they are not likely to be accused of wasting time, since there are not very many matters immediately ready for our consideration.  I  shall trespass upon the consideration of honorable senators by making a few allusions to certain features of the Ministerial statement.  I  promise not to attempt to allude to every paragraph in it. because it is of considerable length, and were  I  to do so  I  would inflict upon honorable senators a speech mot of halfanhour,. or three-quarters of an hour, but of several hours in length. 
 
Although as yet the position with regard to the signing of Peace seems to be somewhat indeterminate,  I  venture to hope that we shall have news of that happy consummation during the next few days. The world undoubtedly desires peace, although there is a good deal happening at the present time throughout the world that is not of a peaceful character.  I,  as an Australian, say that Australia has nothing to gain from a state of war, and that, in the interests of this country, the sooner peace comes the better. One of our own poets has said that we are the only nation "" from the womb of peace,"" that is to say, we are the only people, so to speak, born in peace, and, therefore,  we should hope that our future will be one of peaceful development rather than of war-like enterprise. Of course, we have lately placed ourselves in a very prominent position in the eyes of the world by the assistance which we have properly and rightly rendered to the Empire, because the cause of the Empire was the cause of liberty, democracy, and humanity. 
 
Some reference is made in the statement to the League of Nations. Despite the criticism which has been, levelled at the present plan of the League of Nations, I hope that it will be consummated, because I believe that, imperfect though its present provisions may be, it will make for peace. Australia, I think, requires, above all, half a century of peaceful development. ""With that, and the increase in population necessary to cope with our colossal and continental needs. I venture to say that the troubles of the outside ' world will not unduly affect the Australia of our posterity. If w.e are to have future wars, I do not think that Australia will be really safe until she has a population of at least 20,000,000 or 30,000,000.. "

- My honorable friend says that with hia tongue in his cheek. This journal, in its issue of 5th June, 1925, gives news of the communist activities throughout Australia. It deals with events in, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania, the coal-fields of New South Wales. Western Australia and Victoria. It sets out lists of the representatives. There are ten groups with the names of the secretaries printed. The journal supports every form of industrial unrest and disturbance irrespective of the merits of the case. It urges the fomenting of every possible source of discontent, because discontent brings nearer the day when the workers will be so dissatisfied that they will undertake a social revolution. The names of some of the persons at the head of these groups make interesting reading. For example, the  chairman  of the Melbourne group appears to be a  Mr. Shelley.  He was born in Berlin, and his full name is Joseph Weinman Schelly. He was associated with the activities of the Industrial Workers of the World in Western Australia. Coming to Melbourne, he became  chairman  of the Communist party here, and adopted the English and poetic name of "" Shelley."" He apparently has a permanent position as leader of the unemployed.

- When we call attention to the enormous expenditure, involved, and make out a strong case from the fact that the operations of South Australia in connexion with the Territory have been unremunerative for the last thirty or forty years, we are referred to the national aspect of the question. When we show that the railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek is likely from the -experience of the past to be an expensive white elephant, and will fail to bring about what we desire in the development of the country, we are told that this is a national undertaking; and that we do not take the national view of the question that it is our duty to develop the Northern Territory and strengthen what has been called the "" Achilles' heel "" of Australia. We hear a lot of poetry recited by representatives of South Australia, but when we point to the cost and almost uselessness of the undertaking, we are reproached as anti-nationalists, as if it were not one of the first duties of a representative of the Commonwealth to inquire the reason for every pound of expenditure called for, and whether it will effect the purpose we desire to attain. If I thought that the putting of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 of Commonwealth money into the Northern Territory, under the hard-and-fast conditions laid down in this Bill, would be the most effective way in which to realize the desire of the Commonwealth in connexion with it, I should have no objection to the proposal. But I say that the attitude assumed by the Government fetters honorable senators and prevents them from considering the matter from that national point of view. . But even if we expend £3,000,000, £4,000,000 or .£5,000,000 upon the construction of the transcontinental railway from Port Darwin to Port Augusta, we shall be very little nearer the goal which we have in view.

-On the whole  Senator Carrick  maintained, in my view, a temperate tone and I hope it will be adhered to by the rest of the speakers in this debate. We do no service to the brave men to whom he has referred by indulging in any hymn of hate against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I believe that in general 
 
Understandably, there is in the United States, as there is in the rest of the world, a justifiable concern with what I believe are clear-cut manifestations of repression of opinion by dissident intellectuals in the Soviet Union. On the one hand we have to strive to conduct our relations with the Soviet Union in such a way as to promote the detente. We have to face up to the fact that, whatever anybody may think about the Soviet Union, it is not going to be puffed out of existence; it is here to stay for the foreseeable future. We have to learn to live with it, just as the Soviet Union has to face the fact that it has to learn to live with the capitalist United States. I believe- I agree with  Senator Carrick  on this - that we do not do any service to the cause of detente or to the cause of liberty throughout the world by remaining silent about the repression which I believe is occurring in relation to dissidents in the Soviet Union. 
 
At the same time I suggest- I do not do this in any contentious or partisan way- that when we are talking of human freedom we should be aware also of selective indignation. I think we should bear in mind that civilised men throughout the world also should be appalled and disturbed at what has happened in Chile in recent weeks. I think the United Nations should conduct an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of the great Chilean poet, Pablo Neruda, who may have died naturally of cancer; but there are certain circumstances surrounding his death that I would like to see probed. We also should be aware that there daily torturings are occurring in the prisons of Brazil. I think it is about time the world body had a look at the allegations of gruesome massacres in the Portuguese colonies such as Mozambique. "

- I am aware of the lampooning that has occurred in the last couple of days. I am told that some of the programs shown last night, were at my expense, some of the funniest that have been seen on television for some time. In one way or another, perhaps something has been done to stimulate the programming of good humour for the Australian public. At the outset 1 would like to say that the points system, which has been designed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and put to the commercial licensees for their consideration at this stage, is not an attempt to dictate what the public should or should not see. No one is being forced to show any program. No one is being forced to televise a poetry reading. I notice that some newspapers have picked out the description of 'poetry' from the general overall description of 'arts programs'. The system is designed as a genuine attempt to give encouragement to a better balance of programming arrangements. From everything that has been stated in the newspapers and on radio and television there appears to be a basic misunderstanding of the function of the points system that has been designed by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. 
 
As I said yesterday, the simple fact is that commercial ratings dictate the sort of programs which are to be shown to the public. Doubtless, these ratings will always remain he ultimate guide to commercial program planners. In other words, programs of sporting events to which the honourable senator has referred, quiz shows and certainly high quality drama are not likely to disappear under this system because public appeal and public demand will ensure that that type of programming will continue. This is why under this new points system programs on the arts receive more points than sports programs. No points are awarded for imported programs. This does not mean that we will not be seeing American and British programs on our television screens. As I have said, public demand will ensure a continuation of sports programs, quiz programs and drama programs. Because public demand will ensure a continuity of those productions, what we are setting out to achieve through the points system is better overall planning and programming arrangements. "

- I have seen the report which appeared in at least one if not 2 morning newspapers. The report is not quite correct. The introduction of a new points system is a serious attempt on the part of the Government and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to improve 1jj6s/73-  s-  I6U the quality and standard of Australian television and to remove, to some extent, many of the anomalies and weaknesses in the current straight quota system by which a station gets the same number of quota percentage points, as it were, for a gardening talk as it would for employing many Australians on a professional variety program. I note that one of the newspapers which gave coverage to the report has proposed this morning to conduct a poll of its readers on the proposed points system. Given that the details of the system as published by the newspaper are incomplete and deficient, frankly such a proposal can be regarded only as being thoroughly irresponsible. It would be like conducting an election before any of the parties had a chance to outline their policies. The results of any such poll cannot be considered to be at all relevant. If the newspaper concerned had waited until full details of the system had been made public, as they are expected to be next month after the Broadcasting Control Board has had dicussions with the licensees of the commercial stations, as is required under the Broadcasting and Television. Act, it would have been much more responsible and it might even have been helpful. I suggest that, a poll at this stage would be utterly irrelevant. 
 
It is most unlikely that Australian television viewers are about to be deluged by a spate of poetry readings on television in peak hour viewing times. Commercial stations are goverened to a very large extent by the rating systems, and the proposals set -out by the Control Board at this stage and which have just been forwarded to the commercial stations allow for complete flexibility in the programming arrangements of the stations. It is not mandatory for a station to program according to each category which is set out. I can hardly visualise, for instance, Abigail of 'Number 96' being charged with responsibility of singing 'The Last Rose of Summer' or Paul Hogan of Channel 9 being asked to recite for an hour Henry Lawson's poem 'Faces in the Street'. The existing standards contain a category for the arts. Despite the fact that there is such a category, very little, if any, of this type of programming has been carried out. If stations want to carry it out, they are entitled to do so and they are entitled to receive a points credit for doing it. Whether they do so is a matter .for them. The new system will allow complete flexibility in their programming arrangements. "

Arab organisation, I do not find them any more appalling than the murders that took place in Beirut only recently of the leaders of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. I cannot say it is disgraceful to murder the Israeli athletes, which it is; but that somehow it is different, it is not, so bad, to murder one of the leading Arab poets"" in his own home in Beirut or to capture a man in his home city of Beirut and take him to Israel and, by a most extraordinary distortion of any judicial process, charge him with belonging to an illegal organisation when the organisation was legal in the country in which he lived but illegal in Israel. 
 
To bring him to Israel and charge him with being a member of an illegal organisation, which is what is being done at the present time, would be parallel to someone from South Africa coming to Australia, kidnapping a member of the South African Defence and Aid Fund and taking him to Johannesburg and trying him for being a member of an illegal organisation when the organisation to which he belonged was perfectly legal in this country. So I do not think we ought to discuss the question on the basis of who committed the acts of terrorism. What I think we have to do is try to resolve a very difficult problem. For this reason 1 believe that the approach of the Government and, I think, in general terms the approach of the amendment which has been foreshadowed by  Senator Sim,  are attempt's to do this by saying that we should have an evenhanded policy. What contribution can Australia possibly make to the settlement of this dispute and what possible assistance can we give to the Australian who is at present sitting as  Chairman  of the Security Council in resolving these difficulties if, before we even start to discuss them, we say the Arabs are right and the Israelis are wrong, or vice versa.

- The Australian Democratic Labor Party will not oppose the amendments, which we all know are part of a package. We accept the situation but I repeat what I said yesterday- this does not determine the fight for educational equality, it is only an armistice and the fight will continue in the years to come. I think it was a pity that the Government did not follow the wishes of the Minister for Education  (Mr Beazley)  who, as we all know, wanted to continue basic grants for category A schools but was overruled. We have had all this trouble which obviously had an effect upon his health. I think he could have been saved that trouble and saved the strain upon his health if the Government had been prepared at that time to do what it now says it is prepared to do. I hope that 
 
I have noticed in the Press varied reactions. Some newspapers say that the Government won and some say that we won- like the poem on the battle of Killiecrankie. I do not think anybody will win until the day comes when we have full educational justice. I deplore all the talk about aid for schools. We are not giving aid to schools; we are giving aid to Australian children. They are the people we are helping. When people say that Scotch College in Melbourne or St Joseph's College in Sydney should not be given any money because they are wealthy schools, they are saying that every one of the children attending those schools is a wealthy child. Anybody who has had any association with those schools knows perfectly well, firstly, that very large numbers of scholarships are given to children who are in need and who attend those schools and, secondly, that many of the children who attend them do so because their parents make sacrifices and in many cases both the father and the mother work. When it is said that assistance is being taken away from these schools, actually the assistance is being taken away from the child and his father and mother who are making sacrifices in order to maintain him at one of those schools. 
 
So I say once again that as far as the Democratic Labor Party is concerned this is only an episode in the fight. We regard this as merely a stepping stone to another campaign to get justice for schools and to establish the principle that we are not aiding schools which are the property of religious denominations; we are aiding Australian children who are attending these schools. That is the principle on which we stand. However, as I have said, we have declared an armistice and we will go along with it for the time being. "

- For nearly 20 years of my career I was a teacher of Latin. I was very impressed with one line by the Roman poet Virgil which goes: 'Timeo danaos et dona ferentes'- 'I fear the Greeks when they come bearing gifts'. When I listened to my friend  Senator Wheeldon  upholding the right of the Australian Democratic Labor Party not to be criticised and when I tried to recall to mind 95 per cent of the speeches which 
 
I listened to his eloquent defence of the Australian Council for the Arts. I appreciate the wonderful effort which the Australian Labor Party made before the last election to conciliate people interested in the arts. The effort was so successful that when  Mr Whitlam  held a meeting he had footballers, cricketers, tennis players, dancers and actors attending the meetings. As a matter of fact, I was told that they would have had Piping Lane, the winner of the Melbourne Cup, on stage except that he was not old enough to vote. I only want to say this: As active and energetic as people associated with the arts were in the interests of electing a Labor government, they are just as active and energetic today in telling people that they have been betrayed by the Labor Government and that the organisation that has been set up is the type of organisation that 
 
Everyone knows who runs the arts today. Most people would have said that the arts should have been associated with the Media portfolio. The Prime Minister  (Mr Whitlam)  has taken it to himself. The instruction is that any proposal, any correspondence and anything of a vital nature affecting the arts should not go to a Minister but to 
 
I believe that the centralised power of the Government is being increased and extended. I believe that today it is more necessary than ever that Parliament should take action to exert its power and deny this excessive increase of power by the Cabinet and the bureaucracy. I agree with  Senator Durack  that this increase in power probably began when the Government took office. For a period of time Australia was governed by 2 men. "

We must look at 2 aspects of this matter. The Minister for Works  (Senator Cavanagh)  today exposed an interesting situation. He said, in effect, that the ALP is to implement that clause of its policy which states that all contracts made by the Commonwealth or its authorities shall provide preference for unionists. When pressed about Government policy, he said that this is to be a personal, ministerial responsibility. The fact is that this is inherent in Labor Party thinking because it is a 2-way squeeze. The Minister for Works should reflect on John Milton's famous poem, On  His  Blindness'. He should remember one line and roll it around and around in his mind: 
 
Doth God exact day-labour, light denied . . . He should remember that the poem was aptly entitled for the Labor Party's benefit 'On His Blindness*. There can be nothing more stupid than to use another weapon of intimidation - the threat that the Government is to force day labour. If  1  may say so, when the Government does that it will be light denied. But the Government intends to do it in an interesting way. Firstly, there is a thrust on the trade unions particularly to get numbers up in those unions which by political levy give money to the Labor Party. Do not forget that the greater the numbers, the greater the levy. I sympathise with the Labor Party's dilemma because of its massive Bacchanalian over expenditure to honour promises made in the last election campaign, but I look at it with some envy. Of course the Labor Party is short of money, so it gets its funds by duress and blackmail. The Labor Party gets its funds by putting pressure on the trade unions to increase their numbers. Then it says to commerce and industry: 'Let us get this straight: By the most intangible terms which we will not define but which the Minister will know by virtue of his responsibility, unless you are on side with the unions and unless the shop stewards tell  Senator Cavanagh,  ""This is a good shop; it played ball in all ways"", you do not get a contract'. This is the corruption of all moral values. What an extraordinary situation. If we apply this principle, do we take it that

On the tests, this Bill is certainly not a Bill which eliminates fault. It is not a Bill which eliminates or reduces bitterness or hatred or misery. It is not a Bill which necessarily reduces costs. Fundamentally, it is a Bill which discriminates wickedly against women. All I can say is that I commend to every young woman that she get herself a teacher's college scholarship as quickly as possible because that seems to me to be the likely way to ensure protection, despite the fact that I think the poets will win out in the end and marriage will go on with the same optimism as it has for centuries.

- I rise to speak in support of the amendment to defer the Family Law Bill 1974 until the autumn sitting. I am pleased that  Senator Gietzelt  was able to correct the time relationship involved in the amendment and I also would like to reassure him and other honourable senators that the opposition to the Bill is not as vehement or as much like a brick wall as he thinks it is. We seek merely to amend the Bill. I point out that by now this Bill is a grandparent Bill. This is the third time it has been brought into the Senate and each time it has been extensively amended. Now the sins of the grandparents are being visited on the grandchild. The Bill is to be amended another 92 times. I think there are another 13 amendments plus another 2 amendments. As was pointed out this afternoon by 
 
Honourable senators must remember that the Bill was brought in by a socialist. We are permitted to regard it with suspicion because often socialist legislation is long on promise and short on delivery. I must say it has often been a matter of much wonder to me that 2 young people should be expected to marry and live together for the rest of their lives when they are in the grip of a passion that renders them insane. Honourable senators must confess that love is an insanity, a delightful insanity, and it does exist. It was disquieting to hear earlier in the debate that in the marriage situation men are bad for women but women are good for men. I was relieved to hear it. I suspected it for some time, and we have been taking advantage of it. Perhaps we owe women a debt that has to be settled now. 
 
The affairs of men and women are no simple matter. Indeed, they are the most complex matter in the world to deal with and they are not to be trifled with lightly. They involve the driving force of nature which perpetuates the species. All people, as was pointed out here today, I think, from the most primitive to the most civilised, have evolved the most complicated set of mores and rules with regard to sex, marriage and the procreation of children, and the religions have been quick to exploit these fertile fields. I point out to the Senate that most of the major wars in history have been fought over love between men and women or the want of it. All our famous operas, books, poems and songs are mainly about love so we are considering legislation about no little thing. We are considering legislation relating to a big thing. 
 
We have built up a code of religious, moral and ethical standards surrounding sex, marriage and the upbringing of children. It has developed over many centuries and it is based on security for mothers, particularly during their child bearing period and all the nuances that go with it, and on providing care for the children. No creature in nature is so dependent on its parents as the human baby. If we are to change our standards we want to change them for something better, not something worse. This is why we want to be careful about this Bill. This is why we want further consideration of it by the Senate, by the community at large and by all the people intersted in it. The present Bill purports to represent this consideration but it has sent shivers through many sections of the community, particularly the religious sections. 
 
The advent of the pill and other advanced means of contraception has emancipated our women in a most unprecedented way and it has altered our outlook on the man/woman relationship. In emancipating women it has brought them to a position where they are able to philander in much the same way as men have been able to do always. They have learned this recently, I think to their sorrow, and they are beginning to learn the truth of the old Latin dictum of post coitus homines tristus est, which roughly translated means 'After intercourse all people are sad'. It has engendered this permissive society in which we now live. We see trial marriages. We see communal living which is aided and abetted by the huge social welfare payments that are passed about now. As a practising doctor I am coming to the conclusion rapidly that in this situation the only real difference between rape and seduction is technique. Until recently our way of life has been support for the free enterprise system, the family unit and individual freedom. These 3 principles are being altered remarkably now. This Government intends to change the free enterprise system to a public enterprise system. This sort of system has been tried all round the world and has failed lamentably. "

- I said if ever there was a Soviet citizen who had reason to understand and to underline the negative aspects of Soviet society, it was Solzhenitsyn. He was a man who underwent all these hardships, a man who wrote about these hardships, a man who was persecuted for his beliefs and a man who had to circulate his literary works in the Soviet underground. Yet, despite all those hardships this was a man who had to be forcibly ejected from his native country. Despite everything that he had undergone in the Soviet Union, Solzhenitsyn still regarded it quite clearly as a severe punishment to be expelled from the Soviet Union. 
 
I also refer honourable senators to the works of another great Soviet literary dissident. I refer to Boris Pasternak, the author of  Dr Zhivago  and of many other less known works, including translations of Shakespeare and other poets. Pasternak was a man who also suffered from the repressive regime of the Soviet Union. In case honourable senators on the other side of the chamber have not got the message that we on this side understand fully- and understood before them- the repressive nature of Soviet society, I would like to point out that Pasternak was writing long before Solzhenitsyn. He was a critic of the Soviet regime. But anybody who has read his works must be impressed with his passionate love of his own country and with the intense patriotism of this man who was fully conscious of all of the shortcomings of the Soviet regime. If the Opposition senators had this human understanding of the problems of Soviet citizens who hate the repression of the Soviet regime but who still love their country, they would not take nearly such a simplistic view of the vacillations of this young man or of this little human tragedy which, to the members of the Opposition apparently, was just a matter of an opportunity to score some political advantage against the Government. This man as I see it, this young impressionable artistic man, went through agonies for a few days. First of all he thought he would like to stay here but I think- I have no more conclusive evidence than the Opposition has- quite believably, he finally decided that with all its shortcomings, he wanted to go back to his native land.

-That is not surprising; you sleep rather lightly. One of the reasons given in clause 9 of the Bill for establishing the authority would, I think, endear itself to those jingoistic drum-bashers who sit opposite us. Amongst other things, it says:   for the purpose of ensuring the availability when a state of war, or danger of war, exists, of adequate reserves and supplies of petroleum, petroleum products, petrochemicals,, minerals and refined substances capable of being used for the purpose of the defence of Australia. 
 
If we look at that clause alone what do we find? Those who sit opposite are always telling us that we are always at risk. We find that at present these very critical things in a critical period are in the hands of the private enterprise system and the Government has no control over them at all. Honourable gentlemen opposite stand in this place and say that they oppose this Bill purely and simply on the ground that it is not in line with their singular and very archaic free enterprise mentality- a system that has never worked anywhere in the world and that is proving daily around the world how bad it is. It is falling to pieces in every country in the world, and Australia is no exception. 
 
How can you make a bad thing good? Those who sit opposite are constantly trying to do that. They would support a private enterprise system to the complete exclusion of any sort of participation by the Australian Government. Did they not do this with Trans-Australia Airlines? Did they not hamstring TAA? Was it not they who said that TAA could not fly aircraft intrastate although its competitor- I use that word loosely when speaking of these people- could fly aircraft anywhere at any time? Did they not place a restriction on the use of machinery owned by TAA without any such restriction applying to its free enterprise competitor? So when they talk of this measure being some sort of threat to the free enterprise system we must conclude that they are speaking with their tongue in their cheek, because it cannot possibly be said that there is any risk to the free enterprise system. I always thought that a free enterprise system relied greatly for its existence on competition. I did not think that free enterprise was afraid of a competitor, but it seems that amongst those on the other side of this place there is a fear. They are afraid of the Australian Government going into opposition with free enterprise in a fair, businesslike and competitive way with no advantage to the Australian Government enterprise. In closing off, I am reminded of a poem by Henry Lawson, A Word to Texas Jack'. The final stanza of that poem, with a few alterations, reads: 
 
But when they are gone, as we are not, we find that when they go, 
 
They have left behind no  larnin' -  but have carted off our dough. "

Therefore when we vote for a motion such as this we do so only for this reason. During lunch I was thinking of an old poem that related to affairs between Britain and Holland in the 19th century, the words of which began: "

The message in that famous poem is vital. Here in Australia, as elsewhere, we are involved or should be involved with the rest of mankind, and the best we can do for the less fortunate is barely good enough. I return to the thought that it is not just a matter of trying to solve the problem by throwing money at it. Let us say we have this money. That is good. It is $200m. Surely what we must next ask the Government to do is to try to be a little unconventional for once, to try to change its methods so that it will ensure that that money is spent in the most effective way. I appeal to the Government to take that kind of further action, to interest itself even more than it is doing in the spending of these funds by the International Development Association. I would suggest that the Association itself would probably welcome the idea that a donor nation was taking a very intelligent and detailed interest in where the money was going. 
 
In the interests of donors, that is every Australian taxpayer, and the receivers who certainly need help, I would ask the Government members to take such unconventional steps as to send representatives to organisations such as the Community Aid Abroad which has this type of small individual task overseas. They have done a tremendous job for many years with virtually no money. I suggest that the Government should invite them along and talk to them, and perhaps use some of their people who are not a public servants to go along and talk to the organisation. The Government should get together a consultative group, with the voluntary aid organisations, and allow these people to say things. I think the Government will find that those people have plenty to say. I know that what I am suggesting may rock the boat a little and may seem unconventional. I do suggest that the results that come from it would be of sufficient value in this world to make them worth while. "

- I  wish to be associated with my fellow senators in their expressions of condolence on the occasion of the very sad passing of a former Senate colleague, former  Senator William  Morrow. Bill Morrow was elected to this Senate on the same day as J was elected in September 1 946. He was a member of this chamber until 1953. He was a great fighter for world peace. When he died on 12 July last, at the age of 9 1 , he was still fighting for the great causes to which he had applied himself all his life. He was a great man in every sense of the word. He had the great quality of love of his wife and family. It was a very close-knit family. To the members of his family I extend my very deep sympathy. 
 
Bill Morrow was a kind and gentle person. At all times he was a modest and completely unassuming man. His life was one of struggle, but it won him recognition not only here in Australia but also internationally. In his pursuit of world peace he moved in circles with such people as Pandit Nehru, Mao Tse-tung, Chou En-lai, Stalin and Molotov. He was the recipient of the JoliotCurie Peace Prize and also was awarded the Lenin Peace Prize. Mao Tse-tung once wrote that a man's ability may be great or small, but if he has this spirit of selflessness he is already nobleminded and pure, a man of moral integrity and above vulgar interests, a man who is of value to the people. Such a man was Bill Morrow. 
 
Bill Morrow had very humble beginnings. He was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, in 1891. He first began to emerge as a leader as an organiser with the Australian Railways Union. He went to Tasmania in 1936 and became the State secretary of the Australian Railways Union. He took a very active part in the Australian Labor Party and was not only a member of the State Executive of our party but also the vice-president of the Trades Hall Council. As I have already said, he was elected to the Senate in 1946. During the time that he was a member of the Senate we in this country witnessed such great world events as the birth of the People's Republic of China and the outbreak of the great Korean War in 1950. During the debate on the Korean War  Senator Morrow  spoke always of the ordinary struggling people and pointed out that the ordinary people do not make wars; they just do the fighting, suffering and dying, and they have no say in making wars. That advice is as true today as it was when Bill Morrow spoke in this chamber in 1949. He attacked the merchants of death, the armaments manufacturers, who are coming out of their funkholes again at present trying to find excuses for wars, which will be far beyond the comprehension of any of us because of the new dimensions of war. Inherent in Bill Morrow's warnings to people was that such a war would be the end of mankind. That should be heeded. 
 
In concluding my tribute to Bill Morrow, I would like to quote a poem which was written on 15 July last by Maurie Edwards. The poem is headed 'Bill Morrow - Australian'. It reads: "
58,28/4/80,31,1,5,SENATE,1859,0,28/4/80,Senator McLAREN,KTZ,ADJOURNMENT,adjournment,South Australia,,,0,0,"
 
I think there is a lesson to be learned from that poem by many people. When good working men go on strike, people rush to do their jobs. We are told on many occasions when trade unions go on strike- whether it be on the wharves or in the shearing sheds- that the Government will get people to do the unionists' work. Perhaps we will see the day when the same people who volunteered to lock the doors of this chamber today are prepared to rush into the coal mines, into the shearing sheds or on to the wharves and do the heavy work which is carried out by the labourers of this nation. I venture to say that none of them would be able to carry out that work with the alacrity and the skill with which they ran to shoot the bolts on the chamber doors today. 
 
I hope that the work force has learned a lesson, namely, that there are people in our community who have no thought at all for the welfare of the working class. We know how the Government, of which all honourable senators opposite are members, repeatedly goes into the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission every time there is a wage hearing and put strongly the case that the wage earners of this country should not be given an increase in their wages and should not be given better living standards. This is the situation that we faced in this chamber today. We saw it in reality. We have read and heard about it in the past but today we saw those very people in action. The work force of this nation ought to be warned of what will happen if those people ever have complete control. If they are able to abolish the arbitration system, the members of the work force will not have a leg to stand on. They will see a return to the slave days. 
 
I conclude by saying that I give great credit to all of those attendants who acted as one and left this place when their union, after taking a democratic vote, decided that in the cause of their case they would not engage in further duties today. Those people deserve credit. I hope that they will be given justice when their claims are heard in the Arbitration Commission. "

- I am delighted by the interjection. During the varied experiences I found that those who did not think too often came to the conclusion that big brother should do it all for them, but the good thinkers who were employed in the shearing gangs or whatever else thought that there was some advantage to them in working. When  Senator McLaren  quoted his little piece of poetry, it brought to my mind something which I remember learning when I was very young. Without having to read, I will recite something of meaning to me. I think it is relevant to what

The conquest of Afghanistan- as I said before  Senator Baume  reminded me of an interesting poem on the subject- will not be easy. The first recorded conqueror was Alexander the Great. It has been a cross-roads of war, a cockpit of war, ever since. I have no doubt that the Soviet conquest of Afghanistan will ultimately, after a bloody war, be effective and permanent. There is also no doubt that the Soviet leaders grossly miscalculated the position. For instance, they appeared to think that Barbrak Karmal, the president-elect whom they kept under their own hand and who came in with the Russian invading forces, would be able to unite the Afghan people. In fact half of the Afghan army of 90,000 has melted away and joined the rebels. As I said, it will be a long and bloody struggle. Nevertheless we must recognise that we cannot effectively help the Afghans. They are, as an independent people, doomed to Russian sovereignty. "

- The easy way of life, the voluntary way, which has shielded the shirker and the slacker and the waster, must be ended at once. We have clung to it far too long; and we are still clinging to it, hoping that the sacrifice of others will obviate any sacrifice on our part. If we are not to go the way of Malaya and Singapore, we must be a match for the enemy in more than equipment; we must be as hard as he is, as disciplined as he is, not only on the fighting fronts, but right through our national life. The Government has ""funked"" its duty; this poor wishfulthinking, sickly budget is proof positive of that ""funking"". There has been a lot of talk for some time about the wonderful world we are going to have in the post-war era. I say, "" one thing at a time"". The job that we must do first, before we talk about the wonderful world of the future, is to win the war. Voices are raised here and there - not many, I agree - against the deadly danger of the promises now being made by the foolish to the thoughtless about the new, wonderful world that is to be, in which people will not have to work much, and where every one will have plenty of everything. Each week I receive from the Old Country a copy of the  Manchester Guardian.  In the issue of that publication, dated the 11th May, 1942, I read a letter which was printed as a protest against folly and false hopes. It was from the Reverend E. W. Burnell, and it so impressed me that I shall read it to the Senate - 
 
What some people realize who are not afraid to be called reactionaries or any other term of abuse which may be applied to them, isthat so much of what is suggested by the reconstructionists will fail. We shall be a desperately poor nation after this war. Our resources are being devoured at an alarming rate. We shall have to live very austerely. I think it is a shame to raise false hopes in people's minds. We had enough of that after the last war, when we were told that we were going to have a land fit for heroes to live in. Many of the people who are now so prominent in talking about reconstruction are precisely the people who are largely responsible for the fact that we were unprepared when this war was forced upon us. They were in favour of disarmament; they did all in their power to prevent, young men from enlisting. Even when we were on the brink of war they opposed conscription. Such people's judgment is therefore to be distrusted. Though potentially we maybe on the road to victory, actually the position of the Allies is very serious. Japan is knocking at the gates of India. The whole of Europe is living under the Nazi terror, and as yet we have had no really great success. "" One thing at a time "" is not a bad motto, and our aim, certainly at the moment, should be to win the war. 
 
Every word of that letter is common sense. We shall be desperately poor after we have continued the struggle to the point of complete victory - not a stalemate. We must face the hard facts; we cannot "" shy off "" them and pretend that they are not there. We must grapple with the problems confronting us. To say that we are going to have such a wonderful world by and by, when, today, we are faced with the greatest peril this country has every known, is foolish. Let us concentrate on the job in hand. I hold in my hand a poem which was written in 1919. It is really a prophecy. It is worth reading over and over again in order to get its contents firmly into one's mind. The poem was discovered only quite recently. It was written by that great seer, singer, novelist and writer, the late Rudyard Kipling, and was published recently in the  National Review.  Because it is apropos of this budget, and the position in which we find ourselves to-day, I propose to read it. Its title is "

Much of the organization for war would not be possible under peace-time powers. Nevertheless, similar organization and undertakings will be necessary for the work of reconstruction. Broadly our poetwar aim must be the physical development of our country, linked up with expanded production and increased population. By these means employment will be assured to our people and security to the children of Australia. Power to control prices and production is an essential adjunct to any progressive policy of physical development. Such control is possible today only because of war powers. Present powers would disappear with the war. They must be continued by constitutional alterations. "

I recall the story of an American newspaper correspondent who visited this country. He was arrested; I shall not say for what reason. He was brought before a magistrate, and when he was asked what occupation he followed, he replied that he was a poet and journalist, and added, "" and I am an inventor "". When the magistrate asked him what he had invented he said, ""A speedy way to win the war"". When asked what he had invented he continued, "" The other night I was in Pitt-street and 500 diggers were playing two-up. When  they saw three or four policemen coming they immediately scattered and ran out of sight"". When asked what that had to do with winning the war, he said, "" When I was a boy in the old baronial castle - he was the son of a baron! - I was told by my father that one Briton was worth ten Germans. And when I came to Australia, I found that one Australian was worth ten Britishers. When the war started I was told that one "" digger "" was worth ten civilians, and when I saw three or four policemen chase 500 ""diggers"" up Pitt-street, I came to the conclusion that the best way to win the war was to send half of the police force to Germany. We would then win it quite easily on the law of averages "". The editors of some newspapers would appear to know of easy ways to govern this country; but they never offer constructive criticism. I have read a certain anti-Labour and pro-Fascist newspaper for many years, but I have not yet read one constructive idea in it. With regard to the character of members of Parliament I have said on previous occasions, and I now repeat, that the members of this Parliament compare favorably with any cross-section of the public. It is not to be expected that all members of Parliament will have had a university education, or journalistic or legal training. They are drawn from all avocations, and some of the best public men Australia has produced have been drawn from the ordinary avocations. Among members of Parliament there are good and bad as is the case anywhere else; there are grammatical and ungrammatical speakers,  as  is the case anywhere else; and there are rich and poor, although under the Chifley regime there are very few rich among us. We have all kinds of people among members of Parliament. From my knowledge of the Parliament, and my reading of its history, I am convinced that presentday members compare more than favorably with public men of the past. Parliament has gone through certain developments. It is no longer a club, as it was in years gone by. It is a business institution which must deal with thousands of problems. I hold a very high opinion of members of Parliament generally, and of debates in this Parliament. [ admit that the standard of our debates can be improved, and that some of us could be more grammatical in our speech ; but in that respect we are as capable as those who traduce the Parliament. 
 
I do not propose to take action against the Sydney  Daily Telegraph.  I sincerely hope that that journal will do its best to uphold our democratic parliamentary institution in the knowledge that this Parliament does its best in the interests of the nation. I hope that in its reports in the future it will deal  with  proceedings in this Parliament in a proper and fitting manner. "

He had a striking and pleasing personality, and many members of this Parliament, including myself, are indebted to him because of the fact that on many occasions drab moments have been brightened by his interesting and cheerful conversation. I have met only one other man who possessed personal gifts similar to those of  Mr. Collins.  He also had an extraordinary love of Australian poetry, and his ability to recite the works of Australian poets in a most pleasing voice was remarkable. We regard his deathas a great personal loss. Apart from his many social qualities he was a man of shrewdness and common sense. He knew the people of his electorate well, and he was well acquainted with the needs of the people of Australia. He was a true Australian, and one of those bright spirits whom this country can ill afford to lose. He took a deep interest and played an active part in public life andwas agreeable in all his personal and social relationships. I join with the Minister for Trade and Customs "

Reference was made by  His  Royal Highness to the disastrous drought and its effect upon the food front in this country at a time when maximum production was required. Forty years before Japan moved towards the South-West Pacific, the greatest of all Australian poets, Henry Lawson, warned of the time when this country would be faced with "" an enemy at the harbour gate, and a raging drought behind "". Australia let Henry Lawson starve, and then, when he died, erected a bronze statue to bis memory. At that time the people of this country were not sufficiently educated on such matters as the fundamental causes of soil erosion to take heed of the warnings given by Henry Lawson. After all, what could a poet be expected to know of irrigation or national defence? Possibly, because of their ignorance, the Australian people were justified in adopting that attitude,but in the light of scientific discoveries, there is no excuse for us to-day. The late  Dr. Bradfield,  Ion Idriess, William Hatfield, F. R. V. Timbury, Brunston Fletcher, and many other authors, have dealt at length with this matter, pointing to the danger of procrastination, and advancing ideals which, in their opinion, constitute the solution of the problem. It is estimated that of 200,000,000 acres of land formerly under cultivation in Australia, 60,000,000 have now been rendered worthless. This loss is continuing at the rate of 2,000,000 acres a year. Obviously, the problem is one demanding our immediate and urgent attention. The Bradfield plan, the Idriess ""Boomerang plan "", and other projects must be investigated fully and definite and immediate action taken not only to arrest, but also ultimately to remove for all time, this menace which threatens to destroy vast areas of this continent. Experts agree that the fundamental cause of the problem is to be found in the interior - the so-called "" dead heart "" of Australia. Closer in, denudation has been caused by over-stocking, and in the agricultural districts, particularly the. Mallee, by incorrect methods of farming and the removal of trees, shrubs and heritage which formed a natural binder for the soil. Probably there are many other contributory causes, most of which, no doubt, are known to experts and scientists who specialize in the study of soil erosion. These factors must receive our immediate attention, and must be dealt with in the light of our scientific knowledge of the subject. Water conservation, afforestation, irrigation, reticulation, and education are all part and parcel of the solution which goes much farther than merely indicating to the farmer the correct method of working land or telling the grazier the number of sheep that he should run on his property to get it back to normal. The price of land, and farmers' commitments to the banks must also be taken into consideration. A national system of debt adjustment must be implemented in cooperation with the States to enable farmers to join in a general plan of rehabilitation. . The whole question of what constitutes a fair and reasonable price for land must be explored, decided and stabilized to ensure that land values shall not be inflated and thereby undermine the fundamental structure of a national plan. The problem in the interior of this continent is such that its solution demands huge schemes of water conservation, irrigation, reticulation and afforestation on a scale unprecedented in the history of Australia, and whether we like it or not we must face this problem and implement national projects which are essential for the future welfare of Australia. These projects are part of a general pattern for the building up of our population to the degree necessary to defend this country in any future wars. Already the Government of Western Australia has taken the initiative and has decided to harness the River Ord in the east Kimberly ranges. Plans for this project are being prepared, and the work will proceed as rapidly as possible. The chief engineer of the Government of Western Australia highly commends the scheme, and has given an estimate of the fertile country which will be brought under cultivation when the project is completed. This, indeed, is a big step in the right direction, calling in no uncertain manner for repetition, not once but many times, and clearly pointing the road which must be travelled if Australia is to become the nation we all desire it will be in the post-war period - a nation capable of defending itself against any aggressor, and of providing its people with a standard of living and a degree of human happiness never before attained in the history of mankind. This should be our immediate post-war project. We must call upon every one who has at heart the future welfare of this great and glorious nation to play his part. Then, when these ideals have been achieved, we shall be able to say in all sincerity, and with all the fervour at our command - "

A little nonsense now and then Is relished by the best of men. 
 

             Senator W. Russell quoted from our old friend, Robert Burns. There is another Scottish poet,  Thomas Campbell, whose works some of us have read with delight. In his poem 
 
And coming events cast their shadows before. 
 
I think that the referenda in April last afforded a very good instance of coming events casting their shadows before. ,If the Government have the courage to put forward those referenda questions again, I have not the slightest doubt that the results will be exactly what they were in April. The last matter to which I have to refer is this : I was rather surprised that a Government which is so intent upon improving the social condition of the people should not have indicated its desire to bring in a Bill for unifying the marriage laws of Australia. The law in some States is so anomalous that poor innocent children are frequently placed in a very unfortunate position. It is the law in New South Wales, for instance, that a man may marry his deceased wife's sister. But it is not the law that a woman may marry her deceased husband's brother. It is not  positively  illegal so to do, I believe, but such a marriage is voidable. The singular thing is that, if either party to such a marriage chooses to break away from it, the children are illegitimate. "

- No; they are debarred under the law, and, moreover, they have taken an oath of allegiance, which, prevents them from taking advantage of the means of redress which are open to other citizens. I know of young men of the age of twenty-one and twenty-two who are coming into the service of the Commonwealth as sergeant-  majors, who are single men, and who have not resting upon them the responsibilities that apply to their married confreres. They are receiving £156 a year. Side by side with them, however, there are men serving in the same ranks, doing the same work, and doing it better than the young men, because they have practically given the whole of their life to the service of the country. Yet they receive only the same pay as men who have just come into the service. .That is an anomaly that ought to be rectified. I do not say that the men who have recently joined under the new Defence scheme are receiving more than they are entitled to get, but I am certainly of opinion that consideration should be given to men who have been ten or twelve years in the service, some of whom are forty-four years of age and over, and who have families of five or six dependent upon them. Surely these men should receive more consideration than those who are mere neophytes in the art of war. I know that it will be said that what I am arguing involves differentiating between married and single men, and between those who have been a considerable time in the service and those who have just entered. Nevertheless an anomaly does exist which ought not to continue, and I felt bound to voice the views which have been presented to me by certain sections of employes. I also have a word to say in regard to the administration of the Commonwealth Literary Fund. There are men and women in our midst who have rendered good service to the State as authors. Some of them may not have done very much manual work, but those who have spent their lives as prose writers and poets have assisted largely to mould the thoughts of the people. I do not think that the Commonwealth has treated them as generously as it should have done, through the meagre allowance that is made by means of the Commonwealth Literary Fund. A case has been brought under my notice. It is that ot an individual who I know enjoyed in the past the esteem and respect of the people in the community where he dwelt. Owing to one of the fickle turns of fortune's wheel, and through no fault of his own, he has been practically left stranded, and is now one of the flotsam andi jetsam of life. He has done something with his pen for the literary life of Australia - something to advance this country in the eyes of the literary world, and to uplift and ennoble its people. . I allude to the claims of the Rev.  Mr. Zillmann,  who, I think, has been treated harshly, and whose case should be regarded as a proper one for the receipt of benefits under the Commonwealth Literary Fund. "

- I have one other quotation to make to show that a promise was definitely made. Thereis a wellknown gentleman whom we are all pleased to have still with us. Some of the great Federalists have passed away, and can no longer, take the responsibility for their words. The one from whom I have just quoted is still filling a prominent position. There isanother who is also prominent in the affairs of this country. He recognised that Federation would be a mere farce if one-third of the continent was left out. He knew that Western Australia at that time was in a prosperous condition. She was building up her secondary industries. 
 
Her people recognised that if they joined the Federation without getting a  quid fro quo  those secondary industries would be destroyed by the competition of the more advanced eastern States . As a matter of fact, . many of our secondary industries have been snuffed out by competition. The authority to whom I now wish to refer knew the feeling in the West. I refer to

When recently reading a life of Burns, I noticed that at one time the great Scotchman was entertained by one of the lairds and  wa3  not treated very well, and that in the course of a poem referring to the function he wrote that it was deeds, not words that make men loved. Australia's great need to-day is not words but deeds. It is, therefore, my intention to permit the Government to proceed as quickly as possible with its legislative work. I find that the speech is simply a repetition of certain previous promises, many of which have not been fulfilled. The mover of the motion under consideration prided himself upon the fact that the present Government had had six years of office, but he failed to tell the Senate what the Government had done during that period for the advancement of the country's interests. It would be impossible for me to supply that information, because the Government has done nothing that has in any way advanced the interests of Australia. "

- I do not know ; but Scotsmen never return to it. 
 
The subject of defence has been treated by the experts, and I shall not touch upon it except to say that, as a father, my impression of compulsory military training is that it makes better chaps of our boys. A little bit of discipline is good for everybody. Discipline is really the foundation of an independent spirit. I do not think that any undisciplined person ever has a really independent spirit. You cannot control others until you have learnt self-control. Compulsory training taught young fellows to stand upright, and to look their fellow men in the face. T must admit that I was not impressed with the statement on behalf of the late Government by  Sir William  Glasgow that it discontinued military training in country districts because it cost a little more than similar training in the cities. That is not giving a fair spin to the country towns, and it is setting a bad example to those who come after. 
 
We have heard a lot of talk about Russia. I know so little about my own country that I would not dare to dogmatize about another, but I have had some opportunity to study the constitution of Russia, aud I commend two principles of that constitution, not merely to the present occupants of the treasury bench, but to the people of this country generally. The first of those principles is that it is not merely the responsibility, but the privilege, of every worker to be trained in arms so that he may defend his country. The second principle is expressed, so far as the accuracy of the translation can be trusted, in these words, "" It is the duty of every citizen of the Soviet to work, under the principle that he who does not work, neither shall he eat."" The present condition of Russia is probably not much worse than it has been for many centuries. That unfortunate country may be on the way to something better. We all hope that it is. If it. is to achieve something better, I firmly believe that that will be done by insistence on those two principles : work, and a feeling of responsibility and privilege, and the need to prepare oneself for the defence of one's country. With us there seems to be an inclination to rely entirely upon the League of Nations. 1 am a great believer in the League of Nations, but I cannot close my eyes to the fact that, right, through the centuries, all wars have had economic causes. Is the world to-day removing the economic causes of war? The United States of America is the country from which peace pacts come. That country is insisting upon the payment to the last farthing of war loans which were, shall I say, rather usuriously lent to the Allies. The United States of America is building its tariff wall higher and higher against trade with other countries, and it is increasing its policy of excluding other peoples from its shores. Do we find in the United States of America, the great protagonist of peace pacts, such a revision of economic policy as would suggest to us that there is no danger of wars in the future? And what are we doing? We are talking about relying on the League of Nations and at the same time flying in the face of the very things that that league is asking us to do. We are building up higher tariffs and granting higher bounties, while the League of Nations pleads for a tariff holiday and the cessation of government bounties on all articles. We refuse to do what the league requests. We continue to do 'exactly what we like, aud yet rely upon that league to save us from getting into trouble. We insist, and quite properly so,on the absolute control of our own affairs, particularly in regard to that splendid ideal, the White Australia policy, from which I firmly believe no party in this country would ever depart. But it is inconsistent for us to ask the League of Nations to give us any help while at the same time we ignore its requests, and, with a population of but 6¼ millions, and an enormous country with tremendous potential wealth and resources, declare that we have no room for more people, even those of our own kith and kin. I do not deny that we should work for the League of Nations and for peace, but we have to remember that the poet's conception is not yet complete. While we have - "

- I have quoted figures which clearly disprove it. The only two examples we are entitled to cite are those of Canada and United States of America, and in both cases the increase of population has been infinitesimal in the older Provinces or States compared with what it has been in the newer areas. 
 
Another aspect of this question to be taken into consideration are the functions which the States perform to-day compared with what they were in days gone by. Every one knows how Thomas Jefferson in that document so full of poetry in prose, the American Declaration of Independence, laid down the functions of States. As a matter of fact the States that form the Union to-day have  added very little to the traditional task of aiding citizens laid down for them 150 years ago. But the functions performed by the States of Australia are vastly different. Not long after the foundation of Australia, railway lines were projected, built, and owned by the people. The United States of America has never had railway lines owned by the people, and there has been very little of State-owned railway construction in Canada. What there is of it belongs to the Dominion Government, and not to the provinces. The States of Australia are regarded by the people as the agencies that should come to their aid in their everyday occupations. They are not expected simply to maintain law and order while citizens work out their own destinies. For instance, the State of Victoria has its railways, its harbours, its light and power, and its water supplies, which are owned by the people, because the sentiment of the people is in favour of Government control of these utilities. What time would a candidate for parliamentary honours have if he proposed to sell the Victorian railways or hand over to private enterprise the water works which are now under various chartered authorities ? It is time we realized that the States are doing the work of helping the pioneers to have an easier and more progressive time, and that we should encourage them instead of taking from them the wherewithal to administer to the people's needs.

I may be called a traitor or a humbug, and other names- of reproach - the vocabulary of unpoetic epithets has been drawn upon to an unlimited extent by our opponents - but I still claim to represent Western Australia truly and absolutely.

- In regard to education, the Commission reports: - 
 
The achievements of the Department of Education under  Lunacharsky  have been very great. Not only have all the Russian classics been printed in editions of 3,000,000 and 5,000,000 copies, and sold at a low price to the people, but thousands of new schools for men, women, and children have been opened in all parts of .Russia. Furthermore, working men and soldiers clubs have been organized in many of the palaces of yesteryear, where the people are instructed by means of moving pictures and lectures. Iri the art galleries one meets classes of working men and women being instructed in the ' beauties of the pictures. The children's schools have been entirely reorganized, and an attempt is being made to give every child a good dinner at school every day. Furthermore, very remarkable schools have been opened for defective and over-nervous children. Oh the theory that genius and insanity are closely allied, these children are taught from the first to compose music, paint pictures, sculpt, and write poetry, and it is asserted that some very valuable results have been achieved, not only in the way of production, but also in the way of restoring the nervous systems of the children. 
 
This is what is being done in dreadful Russia. But every effort has been made by the capitalistic press to keep us from a true understanding of the position in that country.

- It is, very good. The question is whether the Government will modify their extremely conservative policy and do something to develop deposits which we know to exist, as well as subsidize attempts to discover what at present it cannot be definitely said we possess. 
 
I rose for the purpose of referring, as I have done, to what I think is a most pregnant international situation. I wished also to make some particular reference to this naval fuel matter, as we have had what I regard as a disclosure of a very unsatisfactory attitude on the part of the Government to the shale oil deposits of the Commonwealth, ardb of Tasmania in particular. I do not want what I have said in connexion with the international situation to be misconstrued. It is a grave situation. I have endeavoured to be very careful and conservative in the remarks which I have made. But once more the people of the Commonwealth will be welladvised to take every precaution to be forearmed as a consequence of being forewarned, and to do everything that they can to establish themselves safely within 'the ambit of the British Empire. If the Empire should perish we should perish, and if we perish the Empire would very soon disintegrate. It is a very curious Empire. It ' is true that it survived the amputation in respect of the American colonies, which have grown to be an Empire in themselves - nominally a republic, to be sure, but with an importance in the world which is indeed Imperial. I do not think that at this stage of its history the Empire would survive any further amputations. If the Commonwealth or South Africa were dissevered from the Empire, or if we lost India, the Empire as an Empire, in the sense in which we understand it, would very soon go to pieces. God forbid that such a thing should happen, for, beyond all doubt, the Empire, with whatever defects it may possess, is one of the greatest civilizing influences .that have ever appeared upon the' world's stage. The hope of civilization really rests uponthe maintenance of the British Empire, possessed, as it is, of those ideals which are shown to be more and more elevated every day. The people of the Commonwealth proved, in connexion with the recent war, that they have inherited the spirit which is peculiarly British. They have proved themselves capable of great efforts ; they have shown themselves to be stern and steadfast in the face of apparently overwhelming disaster; and their best care for the future should be to take heed of the words of the most modern and most virile of English poets - "

I am supposed to be a friend of the capitalist ' and a supporter of his interests; but I look upon capital as I look upon labour, and regard them both as necessary instrumentalities in the creation of wealth and as instrumentalities only. I know that there is nothing original in what I am about to say, and that it has been clearly stated by others who are more competent to speak on the question of the factor I have mentioned than I am. I attach . first importance to brain power and organizing ability. Brains create wealth; and capital and labour are no more in themselves than the shovel in the hands of the workman. The shovel is but an instrument in the hands of the workman who is winning ore or digging coal; and everything depends upon the manner in which the shovel is handled. It is only when capital and labour are effectively used in conjunction with brains and organizing ability, that wealth can be produced. Capital badly employed or labour uselessly undertaken cannot produce wealth. Sufficient money could be found to place Mount Macedon in Port Phillip Bay, and to fill it up; but that would not be productive of national good. All capital and labour must be directed by the brain. I always tell the capitalist, the labour man, ,and everybody who has the welfare of the country at heart, that they can organize and re-organize as they think fit, But they must always recognise that under tike so-called capitalistic  regime,  or indeed ""any other system, as the poet says, "" Those who think must govern those who toil."" The dominating factor of organizing ability has to be recognised as absolutely essential in all instrumentalities that produce wealth. 
 
I have expressed that opinion from time to time on public platforms; and it is very largely owing to the fact that I was one of the first politicians in Australia to insist on ,it that I was able to enter the Legislature in the State of Tasmania, which I now assist in representing. I shall never fail to drum it into the minds of all who are concerned that brain, which means a certain kind of organizing ability and foresight, is the principal factor in the creation of wealth. The destruction of the -capitalistic  regime,  .as desired by some people, has been ably alluded to by "

.   -  It is not my intention to traverse the many able speeches delivered in this chamber on this Bill. We have had the question of industrial unrest put before us from very many angles. I believe the discussion upon this Bill will help to solve in some way, perhaps, the most difficult problem with which the Commonwealth is faced to-day. "" Man's inhumanity to man "" has not been experienced to the same extent in Australia as in older countries. Neither have we experienced any of the very shocking conditions that were the outstanding feature of the Victorian manufacturing era in Europe. We know nothing of that bare line of subsistence upon which the agricultural labourers in the older countries had to live for generations. We know nothing either of the backtoback houses built in industrial centre? which to-day are amongst the most shocking slums anywhere on the earth. We know nothing of child labour as it is known in older countries. And I am thankful to say that we know nothing either in Australia of the dictum that we ought to be satisfied with the condition of life in which Providence has placed us, our hope lying in the reward we have to look to in the next world. 
 
From an experience of industrial conditions extending over the last thirty-five years in Australia I must say that we have evolved a long way from those which existed at the beginning of that period. I remember a time, perhaps thirty years ago now, when the first Factories Act was being considered in New South Wales by a meeting of manufacturers, that there  was  evidently, even then, unreasonableness on the part of many employers. One little incident in this connexion has stuck in my memory all through the years, and it was that one very wealthy employer thought that he was about to be almost ruined in connexion with the many hundreds of people he employed, because ther was a section in the Factories Act to which I refer which, gave employees five minutes before knocking-off time to wash their hands. We have progressed a long way since then, and to-day there is a greater recognition of the fact that, after all, we are one brotherhood, and that, partly by voluntary effort and partly by means of laws placed on the statute-book, the past bad old days are gone, never to  return 
 
Coming to the present, there is to-day a growing feeling amongst all - rich and poor, educated and ignorant - that birth, rank and wealth are not sacrosanct; that the day of the lord, the squire, and the parson has passed; and that the worker has a right to a fair, aye and a good and full, share of the products of his labour. 
 
In my opinion, we shall never get rid of unrest. One writer has coined the phrase that "" Dissatisfaction is the key of progress."" A poet has sung of "" divine dissatisfaction "" ; and, unless we have something within ourselves that bids us go onward and upward, we, as a community, will stagnate. Therefore, I do not look upon unrest or dissatisfaction as in themselves harmful to the community. ""We can reasonably ask ourselves whether the great industrial unrest spreading throughout the world, in an accentuated form since the war, is justifiable. An examination of the position will show that, where the greatest profits have been made, and consequently where there is the greatest resentment on the part of the worker at those undue and unfair profits, there is the greatest industrial unrest. We have heard in this Chamber that, perhaps,  in  the United States of America to-day there is greater industrial unrest than in any other country that has been at war. That may be due to the fact that 20,000 more persons in the United States of America have, as a result of the war, raised themselves to the comfortable and enviable position of millionaires. In England there is a considerable amount of unrest, and justifiable unrest, because quite recently one of the professors of economics at the Cambridge University told the people of England that, in spite of the so-called waste of the war and losses of the war, the national income of the United Kingdom to-day is almost double what  it  was before the war. The British excess profits tax, from which the Government collected over £1,000,000 pel day in revenue, also shows that a huge amount of profiteering has gone on there, and consequently, perhaps, a greater rise in the cost of living has resulted there than in any other part of the Empire. It seems to me that, if profits increase, and, as a consequence, the  co3t  of living goes rapidly upwards, in spite of higher wages the worker is very little, if any, better off. We in Australia have our own problem; not, I believe, so acute as the problem in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, but we still have here a fair amount of industrial unrest. 
 
I regard this Bill as another milestone marking the evolution of reasonable industrial conditions. Tracing briefly the course of legislation of this sort, I go back to the year 1891, when the late  Mr. B.  B. Wise, in the State Parliament of New South Wales, for the first time in Australia, placed upon the statute-book a Compulsory Arbitration Act.- "

We must be careful in regard to the  personnel  of these Tribunals. The representatives who are selected to sit upon them must be men of sound judgment and of balanced minds. The worker must see that the very best of 'his class are placed upon these Tribunals - men who are capable of reasoning to the best advantage in the interests of their fellows. The representatives of the employers must also consider the industrial conditions which obtain. They must endeavour to sink all pettiness, to be absolutely fair, and, above all, they must be prepared to make sacrifices for the common good. I trust that these special Tribunals will prove a success, and that as a result we shall, in the near future, be able to abolish the Arbitration Court.

If a little common sense is exhibited by both sides, together with a desire to do what is right, I am sure that the passing of this Bill will bring us nearer to the fulfilment of the prophecy of that poet whom we all revere. "

. - This is a very old question. I recollect that within two or three years of the period when the first Senate assembled here, we had under consideration a section in our Postal Act which prohibits people from using the Post Office as a medium to forward money to gambling institutions. Upon that occasion I took up an attitude very similar to that which has been taken up by  Senator Bakhap  today. Although I have never been a "" State righter,"" I stressed the rights of the States then, and I emphasized that the proposal which we were then considering was intended to accomplish indirectly what this Parliament had no power to achieve directly. We have no power under the Constitution to interfere with the forms of gambling that ob tain in any State. Each State - including Tasmania - has its own legalized forms of gambling. The form which is specially legalized in Tasmania is Tattersall's. The provision in our Postal Act to which I have referred, constitutes an infringement of State rights. It infringes the rights of Tasmania, but does not attempt to infringe the rights of other States in connexion with gambling.. When it was under consideration in this Chamber, bookmakers were countenanced! in some States in which the totalizator had not been legalized. In other parts of Australia both bookmakers and totalizator had been legalized. In certain States only the totalizator was recognised, and in others only the bookmaker was allowed to ply his vocation. It was thus entirely within the province of each State Legislature to control the forms of gambling that were carried on within its own State borders. At that time, Tasmania had legalized the totalizator, and also the institution known as Tattersall's. The provision in our Postal Act indirectly sought to crush that institution by prohibiting the public from sending money for tickets through the Post Office. On that occasion, those who knew something of human nature, pointed out that the result of such legislation would be that all over Australia there would spring up a number of illicit institutions - a number of agencies which would break the law, and which it would be impossible to suppress. I am now alluding to agencies which will accept the price of a ticket in Tattersall's from anybody and which - after they have secured a large sum of money - contrive to find some means of forwarding it from the mainland to that lottery. In Tasmania, too, there are similar agencies in every town. In Hobart the public are at liberty to purchase tickets in Tattersall's over the counter. I repeat that the Commonwealth said to Tasmania, ""You shall not' carry on gambling in this form."" The Tasmanian representatives pointed out that if the Commonwealth desired to be consistent it should lay down the same dictum in regard to every other State of the Union. The Government of that day acted the part of the flagrant hypocrite by inserting this provision in our Postal Act. What has happened since? From that time onward, the volume of business connected

It is true that money for tickets cannot be forwarded through the Poet Office. It is breaking the law for any person to send a letter through the post to Tattersall's, which is a prohibited address. Hundreds of reputable business people in Hobart have during the last few years, at one time or another, been put to enormous trouble because they have innocently put into Tattersall's a small amount sent to them by some friend on the mainland or in New Zealand, with a request that, as a personal favour, it should be so invested. These business people have made nothing out of it. They have not acted as agents for a commission, but have simply obliged a friend or customer. As soon as it is discovered that this has been done, I do not say once, but, perhaps, a few times, the Postal Department has gazetted them as prohibited addresses, and, on dozens of occasions, to my knowledge, they have had to get Tasmanian members of the Federal Parliament to intercede for them with the Postmaster-General.

- That is one way of looking at it, but in my opinion it is not unreasonable to ask that there should be a postage rate of Id. on every newspaper. If that course were adopted, it would be much easier to decide what a newspaper is. I am sure that the PostmasterGeneral  (Mr. Webster),  when he is not composing poetry, has some of his time taken up ' in deciding what a newspaper is. Some little leaflet is started for one purpose or another, and in order to secure a cheap postage rate it is registered as a newspaper. The postal authorities are very anxious that they should not have to register every publication as a newspaper because of the low postage rate of Id. on 20 ounces. If a postage rate of Id. were charged upon every copy of a pamphlet, or poem, or issue of a newspaper, the Department could raise no objection. I am not opposing the schedule rate proposed in this Bill, but I should have been better pleased if the Government had taken advantage of the present favorable opportunity to do what I have suggested. 
 
I do not for a moment think that the Post Office should be a tax-collector. I think it is reasonable to contend that the Post Office should pay, but I do not think we are entitled to expect that it should be a tax-gatherer. "

- The Minister has poetically described the fields of corn, as the result of the efforts of the practical scientists in New South Wales, being changed from yellow to a golden-brown. I may say that there has recently been a very important discovery made in connexion with the treatment of anthrax. The investigation is being continued by a New South Wales organization to-day, and I hope that the spirit and letter of cooperation  will  be given effect in the work of the proposed Institute. 
 
The main objection to the Bill appears to be that it proposes to duplicate ""work already being carried out by the State authorities; but I do not think there is one member of the Committee who will not admit that, in addition to the work now being carried out by State organizations, there is a great deal of other work which might be done by an Institute of the kind proposed. There is work for a bureau of information, in the direction of metallic prospecting, which is not now undertaken by the States, and I believe there is a fair field for work by the proposed Institute without interfering in any way with scientific work now being carried on by State organizations. 
 
If I were asked definitely to-day whether I would vote for the Bill in its entirety, I should hesitate to reply, because if it be carefully perused honorable members will find that it proposes the establishment of a somewhat- peculiar organization. The directors and officials are not to be under the Public .Service Act, but under the full control of the Minister. I shall have something to say about these aspects of the measure later on.

The employment of thousands of men to chop fuel was also done away with as the result of the practical experiments of the men on the spot. If 
 
I predict that in questions of discovery and research the too great concentration which will ensue will be prejudicial to systematic scientific investigation. The very great scientists, those whose discoveries are severely practical, are not those educated in universities. Great scientists are often like great poets, of whom, it is said that they "" learn in suffering what they teach in song."" The great scientist has often had a hard task to earn his living. It is the persistence of genius, not Government co-ordination, that results in big things in connexion with scientific research. Pasteur, and the great French centenarian,  Chevreul,  discovered what they did very largely along the lines of original research. Governments did not do much for them until very late in their careers. Chevreul lived to over 100 years of age. He made important discoveries in regard to the fixation of colours in the dyeing of cloth stuffs when eighty or ninety years of age. He was in Paris at the time of the German bombardment. After the manner of the philosophers of classic times in the- groves of  Academus,  he was lecturing to the students of his class in the open air, when a German shell fell. He went in, and, like a philosopher, merely recorded in his diary that a scientific institution over which he presided had been bombarded by William of Prussia on such and such a day, to his eternal shame and disgrace. 
 
I do not want any one to believe that I undervalue scientific research. I know of nothing more eloquent than the language of a great scientific publication in dealing with this magnificent old chemist on the one hundredth anniversary of his birth : "" There this magnificent old man sits in his laboratory, holding silent commune with nature, and earnestly, yet reverently, watching the sublime irradiations of immortal Truth."" There could not be a more graphic description of the labours of a scientist. My opposition to the Bill results from the fact that I am a Federalist, just as  Senator McDougall's  appreciation of it, results, as he told us, from the fact that he is a Unificationist. As a Federalist, I think it my duty at all times to protest against the unnecessary duplication of State activities. In the present condition of affairs in Australia, in the period of financial stress which I see almost upon us, it will be wise on the part of this Committee to defer the opera.tion of the Bill for five years. By that time many people in Australia will have had a good many financial and intellectual cold showers. They will have had time to reflect. 
 
I cannot help thinking that the arrangements in connexion with this scientific institution very largely savour of these relating to the establishment of the Commonwealth police. That body was established by the Prime Minister  (Mr. Hughes)  in a moment of haste, and the Government do not care about doing away with it altogether for fear that it may constitute an implied slur on the activities of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister dashed in with this matter also, and established the present Advisory Council of Science and Industry. This is one of the things that may well be regarded as altogether unnecessary at this juncture. It is a luxury just now, seeing that we have able scientists active along the lines described by 
 
Scientific investigation promises great things, and from time to time realizes them.  Mr. Hagelthorn  some time ago sent me a pamphlet, issued, I think, at the instance of the adviser of the American Institute of Bankers - presumably a pretty practical association - and including a passage which made a great impression on me: "" Our present knowledge of science is as a cupful of water compared with the whole area of Lake Michigan."" That was an allusion to scientific possibilities. But, for all that, we have Lo pay regard to the homely adage of cutting our coat according to our cloth, and I am afraid our financial cloth in the years immediately ahead of us will be somewhat limited in quantity. If we are extravagant now we may, in the near future, wear a very threadbare coat. I think this amendment is a counsel of prudence - I will not altogether say of wisdom, but prudence to a large extent is an element of wisdom - and I believe it will be exceedingly wise for the Committee to accept the amendment, and, while not destroying the Bill, and allowing it .to proceed to the statute-book, suspend its operations, so to speak, for five years.

 I turn now  to  a subject  in  which I know  Senator Ogden  is interested. After correspondence with the Prime Minister's department for about four years,  on  the subject of the development  of  the fishcries of Australia, I know that the investigations  to  be made  in  connexion with this phase of our activities have been entrusted  to  the Development and Migration Commission, and that considerable progress has been made. I  am  hoping that a great deal will be done  in  this direction at a minimum  of  cost. By this I mean that the States are being induced  to  take  an  interest  in  the subject. 
 
If we can be sure of their co-operation with the Commonwealth Government it should be possible for us to develop this important source of wealth which we have around our coasts. I am sure that the commission will earn the gratitude of the people of Australia if, as a result of its activities in this direction, it will be possible for our citizens to obtain this most valuable article of diet at anything under half the present prices. 
 
I feel that; I have already detained the Senate at considerable length, and I must apologize for so doing. I should apologize, also, for displaying a good deal of feeling with regard to those things which may not be within, the polemics of politics, the discussion of which occupies about 75 per cent of the time of most parliaments in the British Empire.

It is true thathis reputation was somewhat tarnished later by the expression of certain views concerning the democracy and the nobility; but I think there is a good deal of commonsense in the couplet which I have just quoted. I am afraid that honorable senators opposite sometimes regard me as an example of a party man, but I do not think they are right. I hold strong convictions, and when the occasion demands, I do not hesitate to express them, but my party predilections are not great.

But having appointed another quite lately, there is still hope that it will continue the good work, and we shall not be able to speak of it as an extinct volcano.

On this question there are two parties in South Australia - those who believe in the construction of this railway on the land-grant principle, and those who believe that it should be a State railway, and should not be constructed on that principle.

From what I can see of the Senate as at present constituted, there is not the slightest fear of it trying to learn the future effects of legislation from the experience of the past. The Senate has been in existence over four years. We have passed many Acts of Parliament; and unless we have the justice, the honour, and the common sense to try to learn and remember lessons from the results of what we have done, I for one shall absolutely despairof ever having any proper legislation passed.

- They are not exclusive, but in looking through the other clauses my honorable and learned friend will find that it will be well to keep to one definition of a particular subject of copyright. If we do not, it will, I think, be found that there is nothing more likely to create confusion, in the administration of such, a measure as this, which in some respects is more intricate and complex than is a Patents Act than a departure from that principle. We should ""define the word ""book"" as including ""newspaper,"" or the word ""periodical"" as including ""newspaper,"" and not have two different words defined to include the same thing. Then in the defini tion of ""lecture,"" I do not quite know what is meant by the expression "" a piece for recitation."" A piece for recitation would ordinarily mean a poem written by some one else, an arrangement of poems, or an arrangement of some rhetorical and eloquent piece of prose. The phrase is not very intelligible to me. In offering some observations on the second reading of the Bill, I referred to the definition of ""publication."" The matter is the subject of considerable discussion in the  Publishers' Circular  of May last, in which some questions are asked indicating this difficulty, which I invite my honorable and learned friend to consider. We know that a number of  books  are published for private circulation. We know also that there are a number of literary societies - Shelley, Shakspeare, and Browning societies, and a number of others. There are also scientific societies, which issue their proceedings and reports to members and subscribers only. Iti addition, they sometimes publish works which may be out of print for the benefit of their members and subscribers, and issue them to those persons only. In the case of books printed for private: circulation, the result will be that if that private circulation does not amount to publication, and we do not make it publication, the copyright will not begin to run.

Some of the finest descriptive poetry in the English language was written by Byron, and occurs in his  Don Juan,  which is usually regarded as most sensual, and by some as the most indecent and immoral work of poetry we have in the language.

-  Senator Symon  has made reference to the fact that a fortytwo years' period is fixed in the English law, and he says that he understands that that has always given satisfaction. The Royal Commission to which reference has been made during the debate, and which sat in England for two or three years to investigate the whole subject of copyright in Great Britain and other civilized countries, dealt exhaustively with this point. They say with regard to the period that 
 
The term of copyright in books is for the life of the author and seven years after his death, or for forty-two years from the date of publication, whichever period may happen to expire last. . . First, the period is said not to be long enough. The chief reasons for this .assertion are that many works, and particularly those of permanent value, are frequently but little known or appreciated for many years after they are published, and that they do not command a sale sufficient to remunerate the authors until a considerable part of the term of copyright has expired. Some works, as, for instance, novels by popular authors, command an extensive sale, and bring to the authors a large remuneration at once, but the case is altogether different with others, such as works of history, books of a philosophical or classical character, and volumes of poems. In some instances, works of these kinds have been known to produce scarcely any remuneration, until the authors have died, and the copyrights have nearly expired. It is also urged that in the case of many authors who make their living by their pens, their families are left without provision shortly after their deaths, unless their works become profitable very soon after they are written. 
 
In the case of ephemeral literature, such as novels, the author looks to get practically the whole of the return from the sale of his books within a year or a couple of years from publication. The remaining' thirty-five or thirty-six years of the term of copyright are worth very little to him. Consequently we find to-day that works which were published only a few years ago, and which have a term of copyright, extending over the life of the author and seven years,, or for forty-two years, whichever may be longer, are selling; in sixpenny editions ; the reason being that the remaining term of copyright is of very little value. The books have had their day. But historical works and books of research,, as pointed out in the English report, very often do not acquire their full value im the. eyes of the public until many yearsof the copyright term have elapsed. In some cases their value is not fully appreciated until after the death of the author.. If we abridge the term of copyright, authors who have derived no benefit fromworks of that character, would be the less; likely to derive any. The Royal Commission in Great Britain, after consideringthe term of copyright existing in various countries, unanimously .recommend theadoption of a term extending over the life of the author and thirty years after. They say, in paragraph 39 of their report - 
 
We find considerable variety in the terms fixed in other countries, but putting aside the United1 States, which seems to have adopted our existing term with modifications, we find that the moreimportant nations have adopted terms longer than our own. Thus, the term in France is the lifeof the author and fifty years ; in Belgium, lifeand twenty years; in Germany, life and thirtyyears; in Italy, life and forty years, with a second term of forty years, during which other persons than the proprietor may publish a work on payment of a royalty to him ; in Russia, life and fifty years; in Spain, life and fifty years; in Portugal, life and fifty years; and in Holland, life and twenty years. These terms are subject to sundry modifications and conditions; which it is unnecessary for us to enter into, but while we consider it expedient that the existing term of copyright should be altered, we think that the terms fixed by the nations we have referred to are, in some cases, excessive and unnecessary.

Yet it may be that he in no wise chose it from mere caprice. Mercury was, as you know, at the same time the god of thieves as well as merchants, and it was natural that in choosing a garb which rendered him incognito, and a calling by which he could live, he had in mind his antecedents and talents. Therein he was experienced, he had discovered the tortoiseshell lyre and the helioscope, he robbed men and god, and even as a babe he was a little  Calmonius  who slipped from his cradle to steal a yoke of oxen. He had to choose between the two occupations, which are in reality not very different, since in both the aim is to obtain the property of others as cheaply as possible; but the shrewd god reflected that thievery does not stand so high in public opinion as trade, but that the former is interdicted by the police, while the latter is even protected by law, that merchants reached the top rung of the ladder of honour, while those of the thieving fraternity must climb a ladder of a much less agreeable description, that the latter stake liberty and life, while the merchant only risks his capital or that of his friends; and so the  cunninvest  of gods became a merchant, and to be as perfect a* one as possible, Dutch at that.

- I should give him the benefit of copyright for his life. I should fix forty-two years after publication or, for the author's life, whichever lasted longest. I think that would be perfectly just. I might say here that  Senator Keating  quite truly_ said that the thirty years was a suggestion merely of the Commission referred to, but it has never been adopted in England. It has never been the subject of legislation, and we, therefore, must exercise our own judgment as to what is fair and just, and we should not slavishly follow a mere recommendation of that kind, which met with the most strenuous opposition from one of the greatest authors of our time, both as to the period of sixty years and the lesser period of twenty-five years, as introduced in the Act of 1842. No doubt there are various elements to be taken into consideration. Young authors may not know the extent 0? their rights, but the difficulty is that, by this system of giving copyright for thirty years after an author's death, we are practically giving a totally unequal copyright to different works of the same author. For instance, if an author produces a work of which he secures copyright at twenty-five years of age, and lives to be eighty-five years of age,, he has sixty years of his own life as copyright for that work, and then it is proposed under this Bill to add on to that thirty years more, which would give him a copyright of ninety years for that particular work. But if he produces a book in the maturity of his powers, say when he is about sixty years of age, he will only get fifty years copyright altogether - twenty-five years during his lifetime and twenty-five years after his death. That is not the basis on which it seems to me we should place an author in the position of fixing the remuneration for his labour. Then, too, the amount which a publisher gives bears no proportion, as a rule, to what he will draw from the work if his speculation is a successful one. He may buy from the youthful author, of whom 
 
If, six, I wished to find a strong and perfect illustration of the effects which I anticipate from long copyright, I should select - my honorable and learned friend will be surprised - I should select the case of Milton's granddaughter. As often as this Bill has been under discussion, the fate of Milton's granddaughter has been brought forward by the advocates of monopoly. My honorable and learned friend has repeatedly told the story with great eloquence and effect. He has dilated on the sufferings, on the abject poverty, of this ill-fated woman, the last of an illustrious race. He tells us that, in the extremity of her distress, Garrick gave her a benefit, that Johnson Wrote a prologue, and  that  the public contributed some hundreds of pounds. Was it fit, he asks, that she should receive, in this eleemosynary form, a small portion of what was in truth a debt? Why, he asks, instead of obtaining a pittance from charity, did she not live in comfort and luxury on the proceeds of the sale of her ancestor's works? But, sir, will my honorable and learned friend tell me that this event, which he has so often and so pathetically described, was caused by the shortness of the term of copyright? Why, at that time, the duration of copyright was longer than even he at present proposes to make it. The monopoly lasted not sixty years, but for ever. At the time at which Milton's granddaughter asked charity, Milton's works were the exclusive property of a bookseller. Within a few months of the day on which the benefit was given at Garrick's theatre, the holder of the copyright of  Paradise Lost  - I think it was  Tonson  - applied to the Court of Chancery for an injunction against a bookseller who had published a cheap edition of the great epic poem, and obtained the injunction. The representation -of  Comus  was, if I remember rightly, in 1750;. the injunction in 17.53. Here then is a perfect illustration of the effect of long copyright. Milton's works are the property of a single publisher. Everybody who wants . them must buy them at  Tonson's  shop, and at  Tonson's  price. Whoever attempts to under-sell  Tonson  is harassed with legal proceedings. Thousands who would gladly possess a copy of "

- That is so, and I think some arrangement of that kind would be better than the provision in this Bill for copyright for the author's life, and thirty years. I arn inclined to think that the period allowed by the Imperial statute is too long. If a man and his family have the benefit accruing from the right to the exclusive publication of his work while he lives, and Until such time as the members of |his family reach the age pi twenty years, that is about all that can reasonably Le required, and then publication should be free to all. If this Bill be passed as it stands, a man might publish a valuable work at twenty-five or thirty years of age. As a matter of fact, most of the great works have been published by comparatively young men. Chatterton published a volume of poems long before he was twenty years of age. Byron also was a distinguished poet before he had reached the age of manhood. "

- Yes, it is the law at present, so far as Great Britain is concerned. There have been some cases where notes have been added to a book; it has been decided that copyright cannot subsist in such a case. Similarly in regard to a book the second edition of which was issued with an index. The Court has held that copyright should only extend to the index, and not to the book itself. The Court in every case would decide whether or not the alterations were substantial. A particular instance that occurs to my memory is, though I do not speak with certainty as to the details, the poem of Edward Fitzgerald, the translation of theRubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Thatpoem passed through- four editions. I understand that the first edition only is at present obtainable in a cheap form. Many editions have been published of the first version, but I do not think that copyright has run out in the subsequent versions. (Consequently purchasers have to pay a little more for subsequent versions than for the first. There were alterations of a substantial character, sufficient to extend copyright to the subsequent editions. "

- If the circumstances are such that the public are misled into buying the second man's book under the impression that it is the book published by the first man, the question of copyright does not arise. There is no question of copyright in the title of a book or of a newspaper ; but if, by the use of the same title, an author leads the public to believe that his book is the -production of another author, the author whose property is depreciated in value by the use of a similar title for a later book may have a common law action for damages, and so with a newspaper. I think that the word ""substantial "" would meet all the circumstances ; but, as it' appears to be the desire of the Committee to use the words ""material or substantial,"" I have no objection to the amendment. Perhaps the word "" extensive "" does not properly apply. The learned Judge who used it in the case to which I have referred may have had in his mind the circumstances of that particular case, in which extensive alteration might have had a good- deal of influence in determining the nature of the new book. MacGillivray, in writing on the law of copyright, refers to a case in which a Judge held that a single alteration in one line of a poem was sufficient to render a book a new book. "

Honorable senators know that in Germany and other places the ingredients of certain commodities sold to the general public have to be placed on the label.

But the difference between the inflammability of flannelette and flannel was demonstrated to me this afternoon. Flannel will not burn unless a match is repeatedly applied to it, whereas flannelette, as soon as it comes in contact with a light flares up, as the poet says, ""like kerosene."" According to the 
 
No little stir has been caused in Manchester manufacturing circles by the announcement of theSunderland coroner that a Manchester firm had written him that a patent finish would shortly be brought out to render flannelette noninflammable. 
 
The point is that the Sunderland coroner was holding an inquest, apparently, upon the death of some person who had been wearing this flannelette, and some one in the manufacturing circles had stated that a process had been invented by which flannelette might be rendered non-inflammable. That kind of thing is very much like the assurances of certain medical gentlemen, who tell people that there is no reason to fear the plague.  Senator Charleston  is welcome to all the support he can get from his announcement that some one has invented a process by which flannelette can be rendered non-inflammable. It is still the same fraud as cotton tweeds : still the same delusion and the same snare. I am surprised that the honorable senator, who has a record of good work in the amelioration of the condition of the poorer classes, should submit such a proposition. The cheaper the article is made, the more likely it is that the public will be imposed upon. Shopmen will find it to their interest to say that flannelette at 3d. per yard is quite equal to flannel at ls. and ls. 6d. per yard, and the unfortunate mother, who has. to pay the rent, and the butcher's, grocer's and baker's bills out of 30s. a week, will say that if what the shopman says is true, she ought to purchase the flannelette. We need to protect people against their own want of knowledge and indiscretion in these matters, and now is the time to do it, by rejecting the proposition to make the duty upon flannelette only 5 per cent.

- This is not a question of property, or want of property. It is a question of an adult male having a vote, and if the laws of the State do not provide for every adult male getting his name put on the roll and exercising the franchise at an election, there is something wrong in that State, and the sooner it is rectified the better. Again, the senators for Western Australia will admit that even worse conditions exist there, or, if they do not exist now they did not very long ago. In New South Wales, through"" the stupidity of the electoral machinery, a very large pro-, portion of the votes cast at the senatorial elections were informal. That shows that some alteration is needed in that State to make its electoral law intelligible. I do not say that Victoria is in a very much better position, and I am sure that even in the model State everything has not been done to enable an elector to exercise his legitimate right under the Constitution. The representatives of Tasmania have also their difficulties in connexion with the electors of that State. There is not a solitary senator who cannot find fault with the electoral conditions in his State. But when a Bill is introduced by the Government to do away with all these anomalies and to create uniform electoral machinery for the Commonwealth, we hear some honorable senators saying that it is too late in the session to proceed, that it is against the law of the Constitution, and that we should let things roll on in the clumsy way in which they have done. The sooner we pass a uniform electoral law for the Commonwealth the better. I am not going to say that the Bill does not afford opportunities to honorable senators to exercise their ingenuity to make it more important than it is ; but if they do what is recommended - that is, postpone its consideration, or Set the order for its second reading down for a distant date - they will not allow themselves an opportunity to make it more perfect than it is. Even  Senator Charleston  is going to vote for the amendment, simply because he wants to have an opportunity of improving the Bill. He resembles very much a scholar and a poet belonging to the model State itself, who was always in favour of something until there was an opportunity of voting for' it, when he always voted the other way ! 
 
I do not hold any such opinion. In everything we do in this world there is a limit both ways. We can go too far in one direction, or too far in the opposite, direction. The most practical plan is to consider where the line ought to be drawn. Even with respect to proportional representation the line ought to be drawn at districts returning not less than three and not more than a dozen members. It does not matter which would be the most scientific plan ; what we want to get at is the most practical. I have no intention at this stage of my discourse to deal exhaustively with the principle of proportional voting. I wish just now to confine my attention to another point. In clause 18 we are given some slight idea of what is to guide the commissioners who are to be appointed to divide the districts. They are to be allowed a margin of one-fourth in regard to the size of the districts. That margin seems to me to be too great, and I will do all I possibly can to alter it. I want to show what it means. In the State of South Australia, where we have adult suffrage, the quota for each division would be from 20,000 to 22,000. In Victoria or  New  South Wales, for single divisions, the quota might be 11,000 or 12,000; but when we have a uniform franchise, there will be the same quota in all the States, and that will range up to about 22,000. What does a margin of one-fourth in connexion with 22,000 mean ? "

- Under this item a number of articles are very unfairly taxed. Many of them might very wellhave been admitted at a much lower duty, or even placed upon the free list. The goods classed as stationery are widely diverse in character, and  Senator Barrett,  who has been a consistent advocate of protective duties, has admitted that many of them might very well have been placed upon a different footing. Included in the list are albums, birthday books, scrap, motto, and character albums, and a number of similar articles. I recently bad placed in my hands two birthday books upon which the 25 per cent. duty had been charged. One of these was a Longfellow birthday book. Longfellow's poems, published in book form, are admitted free, but birthday books containing selections from them, and having blank spaces for signatures, are subject to a duty of 25 per cent. There does not. appear to be any reason in that. "

We have plenty of local poets whose verses might very well be used in the compilation of birthday books. Longfellow's poems may be selected by the local manufacturers who desire to use them in making up birthday books, but I am anxious to encourage local poetry.

- I am exceedingly sorry that my honorable and learned friend has reopened the debate upon this line, which we have been discussing all the afternoon. To do so must inevitably have the effect of postponing that desirable end which we all have in view, of bringing about as early a settlement as possible of this Tariff in the interests of the people of Australia, and particularly of the trading community. My honorable and learned friend must not think that I seek to discount or complain of his having given us information if that information be fresh. But the information he has given is not fresh. He has renewed his appeal and has reflected upon the hardihood, as he calls it - an expression which ought not to have been used - of those who take the view that Id. a lb. on cheese is in the established condition of the industry quite sufficient. I should have preferred making cheese free altogether, inasmuch as it is an article of uniform consumption amongst the workers of the community. I am indifferent about the importation of expensive cheeses. I want them to be imported, of course, but I want them to pay the highest duty we can get out of them so long as we do not stop their importation. The  reasons which have been urged  in favour of the proposed duty might furnish a strong argument for a differential or  ad valorem  duty, but they are absolutely hopeless as arguments in favour of a uniform duty of 3d. a lb., or of 60 or 70 per cent, on the average quality of the cheese imported for general consumption from New Zealand. The Postmaster-General has given us a series of figures showing the enormous importation of cheese into New South Wales as compared with Victoria. He has told us that Victoria, owing to her protective policy, only imported cheese to a small extent, and that the importation into New South Wales was infinitely larger ; that the importation amounted to thousands of lbs. in the one case and millions in- the other. We are told that this is a revenue duty. ' But what does the larger importation into New South 
 
Wales mean ? If the duty stops importation it does not produce revenue. Apparently the duty of 3d. per lb. is justified as a revenue duty on the one hand and as a protectionist duty on the other. It is one of those duties which performs a double function, like the article of furniture in the poem to which an honorable senator referred yesterday - 
 
The chest contrived a double debt to pay, 
 
A bed by night, achest-of-drawers by day. 
 
I suppose my honorable friend means that it is a revenue duty with a protective incidence. Very good. I admit that many of the duties in this Tariff are revenue duties with a protective incidence ; and I have over and over again said that we must remember the protective incidence, and not remove it in such a way as to do injustice or cruelty. But the question is - Who are more nearly right, those who think that under the circumstances a duty of1d. is sufficient, or those who think that we should have a duty of 3d.? Let us take the question of revenue.  Senator Drake's  own figures show conclusively that the result of the 3d. duty will be to prohibit, or to largely reduce, the importation of cheese. The figures for New South Wales and Victoria show that the effect will be absolutely to shatter the revenue. What is the good of the Government telling us that revenue is the first consideration, and that the second consideration is protection to prevent the ruin of industries ? If there be any parallel in the case, the figures quoted show that the duty of 3d. in Victoria substantially reduced importation, and that a similar result would be likely to follow in New South Wales.

- Poetry is supposed to be the fruit of the imagination. I have no imagination in that sense. But if I were to give a range to my fancy, I might conceive of a time -when Australia was peopled by a highly-civilized race of beings, and that they were overcome by some such foes as Huns or Goths, who cleared them out and took possession of the country, the present aboriginals of Australia being the degenerate descendants of those conquerors. But even if the aboriginals were the former owners of Australia, what possible use is there in giving them the franchise ? When we admit any person to citizenship along with us, we presume that he is fit to come into our company. What are the qualifications for citizenship of the aboriginals? We expect that every citizen shall be educated, and an opportunity is given to nearly everybody to become educated. But the blacks do not conform to that condition. The aboriginals do not trouble themselves about the British Constitution or about tree-trade or protection, or any of the other problems with which we have to deal. They are a totally uncivilized and barbarous race. I am very glad that common-sense for once has gone one better than sentiment. Sentiment is a very good thing in its place, but it requires to be kept very severely in its place. While I believe in the widest franchise possible for people of our own colour, race, and civilization, I draw the line very strictly at uncivilized barbarians like the aboriginals of Australia..

Perhaps I am a bit sentimental about this matter, but I have good reason to be sentimental. To me, the Labour movement is above everything else in the world. I had to leave school when I was twelve years of age. I saw the spectacle, as- 1 suppose did' my friend Dan Minogue and others in. Ireland, of brothers and- sisters going overseas to bed brothers of the earth to get the- opportunity to toil which they could not. get in. their own land. But I did not know, what the struggle was. about. I knew about Jordan, Job, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and the Song of Solomon; but I was not told about crofters' cottages being burned and about people being pushed on to barges at the point of the bayonet and in their thousands crossing the Atlantic and dying as a result of frostbite. I knew nothing about that, so when I came into the world I had to find out about it. And, I found out about it nearly 40 years ago. If I had wanted to sell out in the days of Holman, I could have, done so. But I wanted to find out what all, this, was about and, with my meagre intelligence, I burned the candle at both ends to find out what it was all about. I began to learn about the Chartist movement, the trade union movement, the anti-combination laws and so forth. Like my friend Gordon 
 
Brown and my dear friend Don Cameron, I did find out. In the process of learning these things, some of us suffered a great deal. How the author of this article could be so mean, low and vile to think that I. would walk out after all I have been through,. I do not know. I have been through a lot, and when I read the article I thought of some of the boys I knew and wondered what they would think if I did what other so-called Labourites, have done in the. past, and sold, my birthright for amess of pottage. I feel that they are. saying now, "" What is it. all about? "" Some people have. said to me."" You did not get the selection. I. know what I . would do if L were inyour position."" Only two nights ago one of the. leading, political figures in this Parliament asked me. how I was. and then said,. "" What is going to happen about the banking legislation?""

There we have the other side of the picture in Queensland, as described by a great Australian poet. 
 
Leaving the lighter side of things and getting down to the essence of this discussion which, I feel, has somewhat enlivened the proceedings of the Senate, perhaps  Senator Buttfield  will reconsider that portion of the motion which refers to the time limit within which the proposed select committee should report to the Senate. The honorable senator first tabled her motion a considerable time ago. Had it been dealt with and approved within a reasonable time after its submission, there would have been sufficient time for a full report to have been given to the Senate. sideration of all these matters the question But, of course, the position now is that it would be difficult for such a committee, if appointed, to meet all the requirements and to present a comprehensive report by October next. For that reason, 1 suggest that the honorable senator might reconsider that aspect. 
 
In common with other honorable senators, 1 believe that Australia possesses spectacular scenery which will compare with any in the world. Without dwelling on the attractions of my own State, unlike some other honorable senators during this debate, I propose to refer to certain scenic attractions in all States which I believe compare favorably with scenery overseas.  Senator Maher  has already referred to the attractions of Queensland, including the gold coast. Surfers Paradise and the Great Barrier Reef. Undoubtedly, those are great scenic attractions to which many people in other lands would be delighted to travel thousands of miles. In New South Wales, there are magnificent harbours and rivers. There are also the famous Blue Mountains and other places which, I believe, would hold their own with scenic attractions anywhere. In Tasmania, there is beautiful mountain scenery, and there are apple orchards and other attractive sights. In Victoria, there are the Dandenong Ranges and the Yarra River. In South Australia, there is the beautiful Barossa Valley. At vintage time, people go there and bask in the sunlight. They may drink in, not only the sunlight and the scenery, but also other commodities which are produced in the valley and which are the equal of any of their kind in the world. "

Whilst speaking of the vision splendid in the matter, my mind goes back to the very prophetic vision of the poet Henry Lawson in his poem, "" The Storm that is to Come "". Perhaps, the Senate will bear with me while I read the following extracts from that poem: - "

There, certainly, was the long, distant vision that comes to poets and people of that kind, and to-day there is rapidly coming into fruition the very thing that Lawson envisaged in a slightly removed area. I refer to the problem of picking up our rivers which, in their rush of water in the rainy season, mostly vanish into the sea. On behalf of the Opposition, I express the hope that this great project will be the forerunner of many more, that it will command the support of all parties in this Parliament. It is a national work of the highest character. It should not be delayed by State or party considerations of any kind. 
 
That leads me to proffer the thought that perhaps it is time this Parliament was vested with constitutional power to embark itself upon national works involving more than one State. Some safeguard as to that might be required to prevent the Commonwealth taking strong-arm tactics, as it were. If we had a body like the Interstate Commission reconstituted, such a project might be embarked upon, on the recommendation of such a body, and I hope that this project will fire the imagination of the people of Australia to confer upon the National Parliament, which has had to take whatever con. stitutional risks there were in going ahead with this matter, full authority for future projects of this type. 
 
The bill serves a most useful purpose in that it obliges the two States of Victoria and New South Wales, where the authority's activities are centred, to give, through their parliaments, a completely firm constitutional base to what goes on in that area. The two States, by legislation pursuant to the agreements they have made with the Commonwealth, will vest in the authority all the powers that it requires. It is not an easy matter for the Commonwealth to move into a field of this type when one considers the various interests of the States, their need to develop their own electricity systems, and the riparian rights of many people along the rivers which might be diverted, thereby grievously affecting their fortunes and even, as has happened in the Snowy Mountains scheme, depriving them of whole townships. At this point I interpolate the statement that the Adaminaby dam, to be served by two rivers, will hold approximately eight times the volume of water that is concentrated in Sydney Harbour. Those honorable senators who know Sydney Harbour will have some conception of the magnitude of the Snowy Mountains scheme when they realize that only one of the many reservoirs to be constructed will contain eight times the volume of water in the harbour.

Now let me for a moment speak of water and its tremendous importance for irrigation purposes. I have lived a great deal of my life in the country. I have see over and over again the great tragedy of long dry spells of drought. I know what it is to- see stock and crops dying. I know the problem that is faced by people whose only thought is, "" If only we can get rain to save our very livelihood "". How important is water to a community! Speakers have waxed poetical to-night so perhaps I may be forgiven if I do so too. In this sunburnt land, the thing we need most of all is water. Very often the availability of water has been the determining factor in the settling of this country by our pioneers and explorers and I believe it will continue to be so in the future. The distribution of population, too, has been decided by the supply of water. I suppose we can say that the need for water in this country is paramount. The whole future of Australia, its population, its development, its welfare and prosperity can be effected by the supply of water. It may well be true that in the future water will be even more important than electricity. I am sure that every honorable senator agrees with me when I say that the harnessing and diversion of water may indeed be the most important role of this legislation. The water made available to the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys will be increased by the direct diversion of the Snowy River and its tributaries and further by the regulation of the Snowy, Tumut, Tooma, Geehi and Murrumbidgee rivers in the reservoirs of the scheme. What a tremendous thing that is! Any one examining the map of the areas through which these rivers flow cannot help but be impressed by the enormity of the scheme. Water will be stored during periods of high flow and be kept available for release at a uniform rate during periods of both high flow when there is a plentiful supply and during dry spells. When I think of the weeks and months of wet seasons in Queensland when the rivers burst their banks and millions upon millions of gallons of water flow into the sea, when I think of the difficulties and tragedies of the dry periods we experience in that State, I cannot help but feel that those who are to enjoy the benefits of this great scheme are fortunate indeed. 
 
The water to be made available for irrigation in the Murrumbidgee valley will be increased by approximately 1,000,000 acre feet a year while over 800,000 acre feet more will be made available annually in the Murray valley. But we do not appreciate just how important this great increase is until we realize that it will supply about 3,000 farms and will support an increased population of 150,000. What a wonderful thing that is for this country! What a wonderful thing it is for a country with a rapidly increasing population, a country to which more and more people are coming to live, that we are able, through a scheme such as this, to settle 150,000 people in the area. 
 
When we look at the map and note the Snowy River rising in New South Wales and flowing into the sea in Victoria, we realize that the major benefit will naturally accrue to New South Wales and Victoria. We have certainly appreciated what has been said by our South Australian colleagues during this debate, but we must remind them of the Minister's secondreading speech in which he stated that South Australia also will gain by the improved water conservation in that more water will be available in the river Murray during dry periods. J was pleased to hear my colleague,  Senator Pearson,  express appreciation of the proposed amendment which has been circulated by the Minister, for I am confident that South Australia will also agree wilh us that by this scheme we are achieving a great deal indeed. It should also be appreciated that in a drought period South Australia will receive an increase of 60,000 acre feet of water a year. It cannot be denied that this is indeed a very helpful contribution. "

             Senator McMANUS (Victoria) 18.10] - When we in the Democratic Labor Party heard that the Australian Labor Party had decided no longer to oppose the postal increases we felt like a famous character in literature. The name of that character is Casabianca. Older honourable senators will remember the poem which begins with the words: 
 
The  boy  stood  on  the burning deck 
 
Whence  all  but he  had tied . . . lt appears that we were not the only people who were staggered by the news that the Australian Labor Party had chickened out. I had a telephone call from a secretary of a trade union, whose office is at the Melbourne Trades Hall. He is a member of the Democratic Labor Party. He informed me that a full time official of the Australian Labor Party had come to his office and had said to him: 'We want you as an individual and as a union official to sign this petition telling the Australian Labor Party parliamentarians to do the right thing.' 
 
The DLP member said to the Australian Labor Party full time official: 'Aren't you making a mistake? You know my politics.' The reply was: 'No. We're doing all we can to get our parliamentarians to do the right thing and we want you to sign this petition'. I realise that these are unusual times. They certainly are when a member of the Democratic Labor Party is asked to sign a petition organised by the Victorian branch of the ALP on the plea that it is unable to get its parliamentarians to do what they ought to do.

In effect, the New South Wales Minister claims that his Department is virtually acting as an agent for the Commonwealth and, therefore, the ball is in the Commonwealth's court. That is one of the reasons why I have raised this matter in the Senate tonight. I could quote from Henry Lawson's poem The Cattle Dog's Death' the passage about the dog's eyes growing human with gratitude because of the master's solicitude for it. I do not think there is any need to do so. k is quite obvious that under the Federal system under which we operate, Commonwealth authorities constantly have to look over the shoulder of State departments which act as agents for them. While this incident involves a kelpie dog, it could have involved an Alsatian.  Senator Ormonde  is the patron of our Alsatian group. It could have been a wire-haired terrier like my own dog. I am making this plea in respect of all types of dogs. I believe that this maladministration is continuous. It is time chat the Commonwealth health authorities called in all the State instrumentalities and explained the position to them that rather than have this administration war between the New Zealand Department of Agriculture and our various State authorities, uniformity should be obtained. 
 
When one looks at the problem from the lowest level, as it were, the law relates to every citizen of the Commonwealth. In this case the citizen went to a veterinary surgeon, obtained a certificate to say that the dog was in good health and nol from a tick infested area, and his friend took it to the Department of Agriculture in Sydney. That Department deals with the New Zealand Government. When the New .South Wales Department gave the OK. the owner presumed everything was right. Instead of that the dog virtually became the Australian equivalent of the sputnik dogs that have been orbiting around above the stratosphere. The only party that emerged from this with any credit was Air New Zealand. As  Senator Anderson  knows, Air New Zealand has waived the treble freight cost involved. If it was good enough for Air New Zealand to do that, it should be good enough for the Commonwealth Government to reimburse

- That is basic. It is for everybody. In addition she gets 12% of the basic pay of her husband and there she gets some recognition for his extra experience or responsibility. But those are only two of the benefits made available in the US. In addition, since November 1965 every widow of a soldier of the US Army who was killed on active service gets a life insurance cover of $10,000. The soldier is required to pay a small contribution to the premium. He pays $1 a week or $4 a month. Up till last October the US had paid out $7 1m under that insurance cover. The time is overdue for Australia to compensate on a scale not less than that applying in the US the men who are dying and the men who are suffering serious invalidity. It should do so in a reasonable time - within the next month or two. 
 
So much for fatal casualties,  Mr President.  I want to make a reference to incapacity that is not fatal. Remembering that young Soutar got $82,000 for being totally and permanently incapacitated when he went over the cliffs during training at Georges Heights, we pay totally and permanently incapacitated men $30.50 a week. There is something paid to the wife and something paid for the children but I am leaving aside anything but the backbone on the basis that it approximates the basic wage. I know national servicemen. One gave up his dairy farm; another his fruit farm; another was a dental mechanic; another was an apprentice motel manager; another was a fully trained pilot; another was a medical student; and another was an engineering student. There are all classes and creeds involved. Henry Lawson in his poem 'The Star of Australasia' predicted in 1895 that the star of the south would rise in the lurid clouds of war. He went on to say: "

What His Excellency the Governor-General had to say on .'that matter in 1954 is exactly the same as what members of the Australian Opposition were saying in 1966 and what they still say in 1967. This is rather confirmed by a Statement made by a Vietnamese Buddhist monk who recently visited Australia and who wrote an article in the South Australian 'Methodist'. The name of the Buddhist monk was Tich Nhat Hanh. He is reputed to be a leader among Vietnamese intellectuals and one of Vietnam's best known poets. He is devoutly antiCommunist and is also opposed to the military clique of which Air Vice-Marshal Ky is the leader. Bearing in mind the excerpt that I have just read from the speech of the then Minister for External Affairs in 1954, it is rather interesting to compare those remarks with the remarks of the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Tich Nhat Hanh, which read: 
 
Genuine Communists make up only a small portion of the National Liberation Front, though they may dominate its leadership. The hold of the National Liberation Front on the peasants does not derive from their belief in Communism, but from the Front's constant reiteration that it is fighting only the American imperialists and their South Vietnamese 'lackeys'. The 90% of the population who arc peasants speak only Vietnamese and have no understanding of differences between the French and American motivations. They see white westerners (more Americans than they ever saw French) apparently occupying their country, controlling their politicians, bombing their villages and killing their people. Even when the Americans claim to be defending them against aggression is heard, it is much less convincing than the National Liberation Front's arguments. Every day that the war continues, therefore, is advantageous to the Front so far as winning the support of the peasants is concerned. 
 
We ask the Australian Government to adopt a more humanitarian approach to this problem. Certainly it must agree that from all of the reports which are receiving publicity throughout the world and which sometimes are appearing in the columns of the Australian Press at the very least great controversy and consternation concerning the solution of the Vietnam problem exist. Doubtless there are faults and stubborness on both sides, but surely the great question that has to toe answered by the statesmen of the world is how this holocaust is to be stopped. It is not sufficient for the Government merely to say that it is persisting with its search for the attainment of a just and enduring peace. It has to show manifestly to the Australian people that it has taken all possible steps to bring about a negotiated settlement of the problem which will put an end to the holocaust. "

The question of planning is most important. Many people will be concerned at whether the Commission will be a dollar earner. Concentration can centre on dollar earning for an intensive period of four or five years and then erosion of our natural resources will occur. Where do we go from there? I can take it a little further. The National Trust of Australia has divisional officers in most capital cities in relation to many relics of our colonial days. They arc taking preservation action. Over the last few years public opinion has become conditioned to the need for preserving our history. Attention has been directed to, say, an old time court house or perhaps the home of the poet Henry Kendall, in the Robertson electorate of New South Wales. The Trust has to move in quickly. It :s all very well to say that the slogging work will bc done and then at the top level people will bring along the tourists. In the CSIRO quite valuable assistance is given to industrial firms that do pretty well in regard to serums. But when finance for the CSIRO is considered restrictions are placed on scholarships and research funds. 
 
I would like to know whether some of our big tourist organisations will ever say: Wc have to put something back.' I wonder whether they have yet reached that stage. A lot of them have the idea that as long as they can run tourist buses it does not mailer how they leave the places they visit. Not enough attention is paid to the effects of vandalism. If some people had their way a bright neon sign would be erected at every beauty spot. In Tasmania Luke Pedder is being menaced by hydroelectric power expansion. We live in a materialistic society and there is no doubt that Australia needs hydro-electric projects. But do we have to ruin our national attractions for the sake of hydro-electric power? The answer lies in effective planning. 1 do not criticise for one moment the basic objective of this legislation which is to attract tourists, but we must impose safeguards to avoid excessive patronage of particularly good areas.

I make the further point that Australia is advancing to the stage at which, despite her comparatively small population, she has become one of the great trading nations of the world, exporting and importing - if I may be allowed a little poetic licence - near enough to £1,000,000,000 worth of goods each year. As everyone knows, when our costs of production are out of line with world parity prices, we have the added difficulty of exporting in competition with goods produced overseas. I emphasize the importance of the problem. Nothing that I may say should be taken as denying the need for us, in every way that we can, to restrain inflation in Australia. "

-  I was about to say that. I think that most serials and plays on the radio are produced in Australia with Australian artists. Some of them may be adaptations of other programmes. I think that in time television stations will adopt the policy that has been adopted by radio stations. One thing that irks me greatly when watching a good television programme is the interruption of the programme for a commercial announcement. Without any sense of timing and without regard to the continuity of a play or other programme, you are suddenly taken from the realm of fantasy and plunged into an advertisement about somebody's corn flakes or some other commodity, completely breaking the thread. I should like to know the amount of time that is spent on commercials, compared with the rest of the programmes. On one evening, I counted eight breaks for commercial advertisements in the course of an hour-length play. Some of the advertisements were really an insult to one's intelligence. The standard of advertising has been lowered by television. I know that some of the advertisements provide work for our Australian artists, but at the same time, it is a poor state of affairs that artists who are capable of really good dramatic acting should have to undertake work of that kind in order to make a living. Instead, they should be able to act as they are capable of acting. 
 
We have started to do something for our theatres through the medium of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust. We in Western Australia have a very high standard of amateur theatre. We also have a very good playhouse which is now catering for professional companies. I must say that  Senator Vincent  does a very good job on the gold-fields and elsewhere, too, I think, in regard to the encouragement of live theatre away from the metropolitan area. Because of Western Australia's isolation, in the past the people of that State had to provide their own amusements. In the days to which 
 
T should like to see that revival of interest fostered, because it is one way to build up our national culture and our national standards and traditions. It is hard for us to compete against the older countries of the world, with their centuries of tradition. The countries which have produced the great poets and dramatists throughout the ages have been noted for their theatres and for their love of drama and culture. We in Australia have to build up a culture of our own. It may be rugged, but we do not want it to become common or vulgar. That is the whole point of this motion before the Senate - that the present trend in television, in the theatre and also, I might say, in our novels, is to bring the whole of our standards down to the lowest common denominator, to present Australia as a backward country and on the frontier of civilization, instead of presenting it as it really is, and showing it as a leader in a number of scientific and cultural spheres. I do not know exactly what can be done to correct this trend, beyond Commonwealth assistance for an Australian film industry, protective tariffs and perhaps other methods; but I certainly agree with  Senator Hannan  that if something is not done to help the film industry and the hundreds of people who have the ability to produce good theatre, it will be idle in another ten years to talk about our Australian art and culture because they will have ceased to exist.

. -  I am very sorry to have to disappoint  Senator Marriott.  He may be disappointed for two reasons. Perhaps he is disappointed to see me rise to speak about the Bell Bay undertaking. He certainly will be disappointed when I tell him that the pressure he has applied will not enable the Government to win the Bass seat at the next general election. He will find that Labour will still be able to hold the fort in the Senate and also hold the fort in relation to the Bell Bay project. 
 
The sale of this plant is a disgrace. The aluminium plant which was established at Bell Bay is a vital defence project. That is the way in which we should look at the establishment and expansion of the aluminium industry. The Tasmanian Government could not allow its assets in Bell Bay to be sold because apart from those assets it has other interests in the undertaking, such as housing. We know that the Tasmanian Government has spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on housing in northern Tasmania. Because of the Bell Bay industry the Tasmanian Government built the Trevallyn hydro-electric scheme and is now building the Poetina project, which will feed power into the grill and assist industry throughout Tasmania. Road construction has been undertaken in the Tamar valley, involving the State Government in considerable expense. The Tasmanian Government has spent large sums of money in developing port facilities. The State Government could not have got out of Bell Bay even if it had wanted to because of the amount of money that it has tied up in ancillary projects. 
 
I claim that the Commonwealth Government could have expanded Bell Bay more ably than could private enterprise. The undertaking should have remained under the control of the Commonwealth as a defence project, which could be geared for war production if necessary. I do not think that the Commonwealth has any agreement with the new owners of the Bell Bay undertaking whereby the industry can be acquired as a defence project. It is well to remember that the industry was established as a defence project by a Labour government, but it is now receiving the same treatment as has been meted out by this Government to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, the whaling industry, the Commonwealth Engineering Company Limited, the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool and the Glen Davis shale oil undertaking. All those undertakings have been disposed of by this Government since it came to office in 1949. The sale of Bell Bay it probably a forerunner to the sale  of  TransAustralia Airlines.  We  know  that  quite recently this Government clipped the wings of T.A.A. Eventually it will do its utmost  to  get rid of T.A.A., but perhaps it will bide its time because of the public outcry  that  would ensue. "

David. I hope I do not need to tell any Australian who he was or what his achievements were. Another was Professor Wilson, who was Professor of Anatomy in the medical school. Another was the great Australian scholar and poet, Christopher Brennan. I remember one night when I heard Christopher Brennan deliver a lecture which altered the whole course of my reading, and which has influenced me right to the present day. I would say that if the directors of the schools and the professors who have a world-wide reputation, great character and personality, were to give two or three lectures a year to all of the students in the undergraduate body, they would have an influence that would be, perhaps, incalculable and would make this a great teaching body. 
 
There are other ways. The Prime Minister mentioned them when he talked about the contact of minds. A university should be a place where staff and students freely intermingle, not only in the lecture room, but also in club, as it were, in debates, in general discussion and general conversation, when all kinds of ideas are communicated. That is one of the great functions of a university. That is what makes for the greatness of the old universities such as Oxford, Cambridge, and Paris. There are many people who do not want to take a degree but simply go to attend the lectures of the great teachers in those universities. I recently read the memoirs of G. P. Gooch, a British parliamentarian and professor, a Liberal of the old school, who tells how, after his university course in England he went to Berlin and then to Paris. He did not trouble to take a degree but simply listened to the great teachers in those two great universities at that time. I hope that our university will become such a body, to which people will come from all over the world, simply to listen to the public lectures given by some of our great teachers. 
 
I do not think that this step will in any way detract from the work that the Australian National University has done or is doing. I cannot see that it will impede research or hamper, hinder or frustrate the people who are mainly engaged in research or in teaching students, and who will be students of the super-graduate body. Its effect on the other body, the university college will, I think be enormous, and will be swift. If we had made it a separate university, I think it would have taken a good many years for it to build itself up to the status of one of the great universities of this country. I say that without disrespect to the staff of whom I have already expressed a high opinion. But, by joining it to a body with an established reputation, such as the Australian National University, we will lift the college to the status of one of our great teaching universities. 
 
Some of the criticism has assumed that the university college exists only for people in Canberra or the Australian Capital Territory. Well, at the moment it may. I know perfectly well that some of the most brilliant students from the local high school and other secondary schools have not even condescended to go to the Canberra University College; they have gone to Melbourne or Sydney. However, I believe that when this step has been taken and the college is joined with the Australian National University that will no longer happen. The university college will not be looked upon by anybody as being in any way an inferior body, but will take its place at once with the great universities in this country. It is wonderful how you can do that. People say you cannot do things by waving a magic wand, but occasionally you can. You take a step and suddenly things are completely transformed. I believe that that will be the experience in the university. 
 
The staff of the university college is already of a very high calibre and I believe that when the college is incorporated in the Australian National University it will be easier to attract men of an even higher calibre. "

We hear a great deal about academic freedom. If that means that a teacher in a university should not be subjected to political or any other pressure, but should be allowed to draw what he considers to be the proper conclusions from his own studies, I believe in academic freedom. But I say that there goes with it academic responsibility, or, I might even say, academic duty. The staff of  a  university is not a body which can be disciplined in the way that, say, a body of troops or the pupils at an elementary school can be disciplined. You do not get good work at a university by making people sign a time book, by saying to a professor, "" You arrived five minutes late to deliver your lecture yesterday. Please explain."" Those things do not operate at that level, and consequently a stronger and better self-discipline is needed. In dealing with this measure before us, I think we have a right to say that the Parliament of this country expects a very high sense of duty from all the professors and the teachers of both institutions, and also, may I say, from the students themselves. But I will say this, lest I be considered a rather hard taskmaster: I have found in my own dealings with the members of both these bodies that their sense of duty is that expressed by Wordsworth in his great poem, "" Ode to Duty"" -

The Postmaster-General has now furnished me with the following information in reply: - 
 
The Postmaster-General's Department does not contemplate issuing a stamp series commemorating the national heroes of various countries, such as the current "" Champion of -Liberty "" series being produced by the United States Post Office. In any event the number of other projects on hand makes it impracticable to add further to the stamp programme for 1961. 
 
The overall policy of the Australian Post Office with regard to stamp issues is to endeavour to reflect various aspects of Australian life and development. The present policy on commemorative stamps is that they shall be limited in number and be issued only on occasions of outstanding national importance or of special historical significance.

- Exactly. I agree with the honourable senator. I am merely making a passing reference to some cases. Some of my colleagues will amplify some of my remarks. I am stating these cases to support the table that I gave to the Minister in charge of this Bill. I concede that there are not a large number of people involved in the Government's handling of this term not of full capacity'. I believe that the Bill proposes to take that category of people out of the rejections. However, I believe that we should take the matter a little further. I think I could do no less than cite a quotation used by the late  President  Kennedy because it has a certain application to Australia. He referred to what was said by an Irish poet named John Boyle O'Reilly who wrote: 
 
Organised charity, scrimped and iced, 
 
In the name of a cautious, statistical Christ. 
 
The reason I quoted O'Reilly was that he came to Australia, I understand, and worked as a political prisoner in the jarrah forests in Western Australia. He escaped and went to the United States and made his name as a poet. The point is that there is  a  lot of warmth and humanity associated with immigration but at the same time if people peruse the table I produced I think they will agree that we do not have the perfect system. The Minister in the other place admitted that the Government once utilised the service of Justice Morgan to arbitrate in one case and I think that that method should be enlarged so that we can filter all these cases. 
 
One thing worries me. 1 think that we should dig a little deeper into the background of some of these cases. One of my colleagues asked me once whether there was one law for people to the left of centre and another for those to the right of centre. I do not want to invite criticism for my own involvement or difficulties with the Ustashi movement. "

             Senator ANDERSON - The answers to the honourable senator's questions are: 
 
It is a fact that some persons have been granted 4, some 3 and some 2 fellowships. In 1943, E. J. Brady was awarded a second fellowship after his first in 1941 and since that date 17 writers have received more than one fellowship. They include Thea Astley, S. J. Baker, Frank Dalby Davison, H. M.. Green, Xavier Herbert, Thomas Keneally, Alan Marshall and Judith Wright. The primary criterion in determining the award of fellowships is outstanding literary ability or the promise of high literary achievement of the applicant. Among major works of literature produced by authors who have held two or more fellowships are Green's 'History of Australian Literature', Ernestine Hill's 'My Love Must Wait', Alan Marshall's'I Can Jump Puddles', Lett's 'A Biography of  Sir Hubert  Murray', Mackenzie's 'Dead Men Rising' and 'The Refuge'. 
 
It is true that writers of commercially successful biographies and novels and writers successful in other fields have not been awarded fellowships. As mentioned above, literary ability is the criterion on which the awards are made and in the Advisory Board's view commercial returns and popular sales and reviews are not necessarily proof of success in the literary sense. 
 
All writers of prose and poetry receive equal consideration by the Advisory Board when making its recommendations to the Committee. The submitted manuscripts and published work of each and every applicant are carefully examined. "

. - I direct attention to Division 214 - Prime Minister's .Department, and the item dealing with historical memorials of representative men. Last year, the Government expended £1,514 under this item, and this year it proposes to expend only £600. 1 suppose that the item refers almost exclusively to appropriate memorials to representative Australians in Canberra, the national capital. They would be men who art deemed worthy of some recognition by the nation. Although I do not know Canberra intimately, I have been in the city long enough to observe that the national capita] is practically devoid of any historical memorials to great Australians. I do not believe that the Prime Minister  (Mr. Menzies)  is concerned personally with the expenditure of this small amount of £600, or that the right honorable gentleman has time to consider what memorials should be erected in Canberra. I assume that somebody else is responsible for the expenditure of the vote. I invite the Leader of the Government 
 
There are no memorials in Canberra to men like Lawson or Kendall, the poets; to Blarney or Monash, the great Australian soldiers or to our great law-makers like  Sir Isaac  Isaacs. I could name many great Australians who have not been recognized in  the national capital, lt is ludicrous to envisage the expenditure of £600 on historical memorials to great: Australians. That would not be sufficient to provide one decent memorial for one Australian. The proposition has become farcical. Last year, £1,514 was expended, and this year the Government will provide £600. Will that amount be divided again next year with a provision of £200 or less? This matter is important. The national capital is growing without any memorials to great Australians, and it is time that we did something about it. "

- It is quite a refreshing change for me to hear no interjections. I have found Government supporters exceedingly vocal when they have disagreed with me, whether with reason or without it, and it is a most unusual and refreshing experience to find none of my submissions queried. That is the state of the nation that this Government, with Goebbels-like audacity, calls prosperity. That is the extraordinary part of it. 1 hope to deal in some detail with these individual matters as I proceed. At the present stage, I want to comment generally on this sorry spectacle. What an abject confession or failure on the part of a government which began seven years ago with a balanced economy, a balanced budget, a low cost structure, high overseas reserves, and has had the advantage of seven most bountiful seasons throughout the whole of its term!

- In my speech onthe budget, I put my views forward, but I believe that this is a matter of some consequence, and I should like to continue my speech without interruption. Of course,, we never deal with matters on a non-party basis in this chamber, but I suggest that, on occasions, we can deal with matters, pretty sensibly. Consider this part of the report which, I believe, was mentioned by  Senator Armstrong  - 
 
Economic history will record an impressive list of actions and enactments of internal and. external origin having sometimes the purpose and at all times the effects of restricting freedom  of  trade; but the pages reserved for items encouraging expansion will for the greater part be- blank. 
 
The Tariff Board has just ignored the situa- tion, or, at least, has made no note of it, that - on the information given to me - there are few other countries in the Western world that are engaged in industrial expansion or private investment to the degree that Australia is. The proportion of the national income that has beenspent on investment in Australia for the last three years has been 18.7 per cent., 23 per cent, and 21.6 per cent. Those figures have been given to me with an accompanying' statement to the effect that in few other countries of the Western world does the proportion exceed 20 per cent. Honorable senators should also remember that it is not the function of the Tariff Board to deal with economic activities; that is the function of the Treasury. 
 
Last year, the Tariff Board dealt with? only 5 per cent, of the manufacturing industries in Australia, ' and the other 95 per cent, would, no doubt, have a much bigger influence upon economic conditions here than would the 5 per cent, with which the Tariff Board was concerned. I do not want to decry the experience and knowledge of the members of the Tariff Board, and I should like to feel myself always a supporter of the board because of the work that it has done. However, it would be utterly . wrong to speak on this matter inthe Senate without expressing my view that- in this particular report, the Tariff Board has made serious errors of judgment in its diagnosis of the conditions we face in Australia, and a serious error of judgment in expressing its views in such a provocative way. I say that because we all look to the Tariff Board as an independent authority, and we all want to accept its views as being impartial. 
 
It is  a  bad thing to hear  Senator Armstrong  quoting from the report and saying that no greater political attack could be made on the Government than that made by the Tariff Board. I would take all this more calmly if, in my heart, I believed .that the Tariff Board was right. But it is my view, and the view of the people who advise the Government, that the Tariff Board's report on the general economic outlook is just about as wrong as it could be. When we examine the report we find an incongruous statement in one paragraph. Very early in my political  career,  I was told by a wise adviser never to endeavour to use poetic phrases while speaking  from  the platform. I was advised to stick to plain simple language for I would then not make as big a fool of myself as I probably would if I sought to use poetic phrases. In one paragraph of the Tariff Board's report we have this beautiful poetic flourish - "

The great literature of the British Commonwealth of Nations was produced largely by people who wanted to make money. We would not have had Shakespeare's plays if he had not wanted to make money, although we might have had some of his sonnets and poems. The point is that there are people who arc corrupt and who make money by bad means, but the press and, as  Senator Henty  has pointed out, the private broad casting companies, have not been a corrupting influence.

There may be something to be said for that, but I do not think we should include any hard and last or rigid method in the bill. I do not believe that Australian writers or Australian musicians need that kind of encouragement. Nor do I believe that they will be greatly encouraged by such a system. Tn my view, we have in Australia poets who rank among the finest in the Englishspeaking world. They did not need this kind of encouragement. I do not believe that the public or those who will conduct these programmes are in any way averse to furthering Australian literature and Australian culture generally. I believe that if we leave it to public opinion and the good taste of the listeners, if we allow the consumer and not the Government to decide, we shall get far better results. "

- They are given the opportunity now. I ha.ve heard quite a number of Australian plays of very great value. For instance, I have heard two or three plays by Douglas Stewart. He is not only a great dramatist, but also, in my opinion, a great poet. When it comes to music, I think I know all the worthwhile Australian music but I emphasize that standards are not raised by boosting what is- second-rate or third-rate and pretending it is first-rate. Standards are raised by presenting to the people all the great literature of the world : and our standards are rising. They are extraordinarily high for a country with our short history. Just as good wine needs no ivy bush, so men like Stewart, and Christopher Brennan need no boosting. They are great literary figures in their own right. I hope that as time goes on we shall be less and less concerned about regulating and issuing mandatory instructions and that, instead, we shall trust the people and those who are trying to serve the people.

The honorable senator alleged that wharf accommodation is inadequate in Port Adelaide. However, on his own; admission, there are thirteen wharfs on the Port Adelaide side of the harbour and five on the Birkenhead side, making a total of eighteen wharfs. Admittedly, there are no sheds on two of those wharfs. However, in addition to the eighteen wharfs mentioned, there are seven wharfs at Outer Harbour, of which one is at present being repaired, and is out of use. Of the 25 wharfs, six are used ordinarily by coastal vessels, and I think that an inspection of the wharfage facilities at Poet Adelaide would dispose of the honorable senator's contention that lack of wharf accommodation is responsible for the delay in clearing vessels.  Senator Nicholls  conceded that there has been a considerable improvement in the equipment available on the wharfs. Because of the attraction that the waterfront possesses, I frequently visit Port 
 
Adelaide. At one time the equipment on the Port. Adelaide waterfront may not have been as good as it could' have been, but it can safely be said that during the last few years it has been improved considerably.  Senator Nicholls  said that one of the causes of the slow turn-round1 of ships at Port Adelaide was obsolete equipment. The port is now equipped with all modern means of shifting cargo, including fork-lift trucks and cranes, but despite that fact, the rate at which cargo is handled has decreased. The honorable senator said that trucks that were formerly pulled by horses were now pulled by tractors, which were constantly breaking down. I think that that was an exaggeration. From my experience with tractors, I would say that a truck pulled by a tractor is- less liable to damage than is one pulled by a horse. 
 
As a result, of my investigations, I. say unhesitatingly that the slow turn-round of ships at Port. Adelaide, is due- "

- I think it is also necessary to look at wages, which are an all-important factor in inflation. The trade union movement is more concerned about rising wages than is the Government. If the Government showed honesty and real courage by dealing with prices and profits, it would have no difficulty in reaching agreement with the trade union movement. I am prepared to admit that under the Constitution the Commonwealth Parliament lacks power to do all the' things that ought to be done to check inflation. Therefore, the Government should nave the1 honesty and courage to' ask- the people for the power it needs. The Labour Government knew that the present situation would arise, and we< asked the people to grant to the Commonwealth Parliament increased power for a limited period after the war. We know what happened,, but it would have been a very different story if the parties which, support the1 present Government had advised the people in 1948 to grant the powers then asked for. 
 
I do not wish to conclude without referring to a significant omission from the speech of the Treasurer.  Until the' holding of the recent referendum, the Communists were blamed by the Government for every ill that beset the country. However, in his budget speech which covered twenty printed pages, the Treasurer said not one word about the Communists, but on the very first page the following statement occurs : - 
 
Inflation, however, has other serious effects beyond the rise in prices. In large part it is the cause of the misdirected enterprise, the shortages of critical materials, the ill-balanced distribution of labour and the waste of plant capacity that are hampering industry and construction to-day. 
 
Apparently the Communists have been laid to rest by this Government. However, I remind the Government that the High Court and a majority of the people have said, ""We do not approve of the methods suggested by the Government to deal with Communists "". The defeat of the Government's referendum proposals does not, of course, absolve it from the necessity for doing everything it can to combat the Communists. In the course of other speeches I have told the Government exactly what its powers are as expressed in judgments of the High Court, and I put it to the Government now that it is not entitled to regard itself as being absolved from its pledges. One of those pledges was that legislation to deal with Communists would be introduced and the law of sedition would be strengthened so as to prevent Communists from holding certain offices. However, no new legislation to combat communism or to review the law of sedition has been introduced by this Government, and the Government's failure to redeem its promise must be regarded as one more broken pledge. 
 
I conclude by saying that the* Treasurer and the Government which made all these glowing promises- have now been compelled to confess miserably that they cannot carry out those promises. Instead^ they have told the people that they must: have nasty medicine; This- budget is nasty medicine, and the people recognize it as such. The Government has told the people that everybody will have to be. hurt. The people are being hurt, and. they do not like it. Indeed, the hopelessness of the Government's budgetary proposals reminds, me of the first line of Longfellow's poem, which begins - 
 
The day is done and the darkness falls from the wings of night. 
 
If the word "" night "" were spelled with the letter ""K"", the whole line would express colloquially, the views of many people who think of  Sir Arthur  as the author of this deplorable budget. "

Culture springs from the people, and not from outside agencies. A proper appreciation of the duty of the people to the nation springs from within themselves, but in these times efforts are continually being made from without to abate the national spirit in this country and in other countries. I direct the minds of honorable senators to the words of John  Masefield,  the poet laureate, when he first saw the Australian soldiers on Gallipoli in 1914, when he exclaimed - 
 
They walked like kings! 
 
They walked like kings because they were conscious that they came from a kingdom - the kingdom of Australia. They walked like kings because they believed in the Australian people, and in the future of the Australian nation. They were the custodians of that belief and of the Australian spirit, a spirit that was fostered and generated in the Australian Labour party of 50 years ago. I do not hesitate to say that the Australian nation owes an immense amount to the men who guided the Australian Labour party in those days. The spirit that inspired them is the spirit which I cherish to-day, and that is why I support the motion before the Chair. 
 
The question that confronts the backbenchers of all parties in this Parliament is how to protect and foster Australian culture, and the beliefs and hopes of the Australian people. That is why I am concerned to prevent outside agencies from obtaining facilities in Australia by means of which they may influence public opinion, and change the Australian character. This matter involves our national integrity. Are we a colony in the nineteenth century understanding of that term, or are we a nation in full partnership with our equals in the British Commonwealth of Nations? Are we a colony to be exploited by overseas capital according to the  laisse-faire  conception of economics? The Australian Labour party never favoured such exploitation in the past, and never supported monopoly enterprise. If it now supports monopolies, let it say so. Per haps it now favours the idea of govern-  ment monopoly, but I am sure that it will, not have the support of the Australian people in that, nor will it have mine. 
 
I propose now to answer the charge of the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator McKenna)  that those who support the motion are opposed to the entry of British capital into Australia. We donothing of the kind; we welcome it, but we want to know what sort of capital is to come here. Is the capital to be used for productive purposes, and to further the development of the country? Is it to be used to develop in Australia new techniques and new skills, so that, production may be increased, and the country enabled to support a greater population;  or are we to be asked towelcome the introduction of refugee capital? Ever since the end of World1 War I., various countries have been disturbed by the sudden influx of refugee capital controlled by those who have nowish to identify themselves with the countries to which they go. Their one desire is to protect their capital. The capital concerned in the transactions under discussion is controlled by men. who are frightened by the situation in western Europe, and are looking for safer investments for their capital in Australia. Here they are seeking easy profits by investing in industries which pander to popular amusement. In thisinstance, the capital has been invested in an  industry  which provides facilities for moulding public opinion. "

This is a year of commemoration in Australia's history. The fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Commonwealth has fittingly been an occasion of great national rejoicing and it is appropriate that we should take stock of some of this country's great achievements in its 50 years of nationhood. Since that day in 1901 when the Duke of Cornwall and York, later King George V., opened the first Commonwealth Parliament this country has made gigantic leaps forward. We have survived two world wars. At one stage in the most recent conflict Australia was perilously close to invasion, but the danger was averted, thanks mainly to our wonderful allies, the people of the United States of America. Australia, once an agricultural, dairying and mining country, has rapidly advanced as a manufacturing nation, and to-day our goods are exported to most parts of the world. In our 50 years of federation, we have emerged as a strong self-reliant nation with a significant voice in the councils of the world. Australia was never richer than it is to-day. We are enjoying a period of unparalleled prosperity, and it is well that we should count our blessings. Unfortunately, there are ominous signs that we may have to fight for our existence. The Prime Minister has warned us that the danger is great and that we could -he did not say that we would - be at war in three years. I am reminded of the words of the poet - 
 
This is my own, my native land. 
 
This is the land of the wattle ; the land of gums; the land where free men walk proudly; the land the pioneers won for us. It is fitting then that we should pay a tribute to those great men who were instrumental in welding the States into this mighty Commonwealth. Practically all of them have gone to rest, but their work lives on, and could they but see the result of their labours they would be indeed proud and gratified. To-day, we enjoy a freedom that is unknown in many older countries. Our primary and secondary industries flourish. All our people are employed. Their living standards are higher than ever before, and we have taken our place in world affairs as a nation honoured and respected by all. This Jubilee therefore has a deep significance for all of us. We have much to be thankful for. We have been spared the scourge of war in our own land. Plague, famine and pestilence are unknown, and the torch of freedom burns brightly throughout the land.

- Although I am not aware of the full circumstances that have been mentioned by the honorable senator, I agree with him that it would be most regrettable if, for financial reasons, highly deserving .people to whom invitations have been extended by the Commonwealth in recognition of outstanding public service, were denied the opportunity to attend official functions in Canberra.

- On the 21st November, 1950,  Senator Armstrong  asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister the following question, 
 
Is it a fact that the American poem "" Hiawatha "" has been chosen for production as the main pageant during the Jubilee Celebrations next year, and that a Bed Indian baritone is to be brought to Australia to sing it? 
 
If so, is the Government satisfied  (a)  that there is no Australian work worthy of being used during the celebrations, and (6) that there is no Australian singer competent to sing the title role. 
 
The Prime Minister has supplied the honorable senator with the following answer : - 
 
This production was recommended by the Musical Sectional Committee of the Federated Arts Sub-committee comprising '  Mr.  Goossens "

- On the 7th December, 1950,  Senator Murray  indicated that he would ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister, 
 
In view of the promise made by the Prime Minister in his policy speech to set up an allparty committee of both Houses on International Affairs, and in view of the serious situation in Korea and the Far East, when can the setting up of this committee be expected? 
 
A reply was furnished by letter to  Senator Murray  pointing out that the Government had taken steps towards establishing such a committee, but when the Minister for External Affairs attempted to move the necessary motion on the 7th December, 1950, on the objection of the Opposition, he was not granted leave to do so. Accordingly, despite the Government's endeavours, the committee has not yet been set up. 
 
- On the 7th December, 1950,  Senator George  Rankin indicated that he would ask the Minister representing the Prime Minister, 
 
In view of the proposals to offer substantial prizes in the Jubilee year for the best Australian novel, poem and play, will the Government consider offering a substantial prize for an Australian National Anthem? 
 

             Senator George Rankin was advised by letter during the Parliamentary recess that the Commonwealth Jubilee Committee had something of this nature in mind and was organizing a jubilee national song competition as part of the official celebrations. This competition is for words and music of a song which might be suitable for adoption as Australia's national song. Prizes totalling £200 are being offered in this competition. "

One can journey in two hours from these surfing beaches to the mountain ranges of Queensland which are covered with dense native jungle. It is the finest bush in Australia. There are forests of great trees such as hoop and bunya pines, kauri, red and white cedars, and others which are used for furniture. Every Australian should visit this wonderful area which abounds with orchids, palms, ferns, flowering creepers, and gorgeous wild flowers. The best time to visit the native bush is in the spring. Queensland is a delightful change from Canberra. Its mountains are portion of the great dividing range in Australia, and its arboreal beauties are surpassed only in the Amazon Valley in Brazil. The best time to visit and enjoy this wonderland of Queensland is in the late winter or early spring when the oranges and mandarins have ripened and' the sugar crop is being harvested and not, as  Senator Colebatch  says, -during the crushing period.

I am completely at a loss to understand why its framers have not been able to improve on provisions in earlier legislation of similar character, and have managed to include in it so many repressive provisions calculated to impede intellectual and economic progress. I have in my hand two publications printed in Great Britain, which I commend to honorable senators.  Labor,  the title of one, contains a number of contributions from some of the greatest thinkers in the Mother Country. Haphazard, I select the following from an article written by 
 
Idealists have talked and lyric poets have sung of our glorious liberties. They have reminded us that - "
196,10/4/35,14,1,2,SENATE,1155,0,10/4/35,Senator SAMPSON,K3L,SUPPLY BILL (No. 1) 1935-1936,bill,,,,0,0,"
 
- Notwithstanding our dreams and visions after the close  of the Great War of 1914-18, notwithstanding all the talk at the time that it was "" a war to end war,"" and that the nations thereafter would settle their differences, not by resort to arms, but by arbitration, we find that the nations of the world to-day are vieing with each other in their preparations for war. This vast and sparsely-settled country of ours is one of the richest prizes that any nation strong enough to take it could secure. The first duty of any government, no matter what its politics may be, is therefore"" to prepare for its defence, so that the manhood of Australia may be able, should the occasion arise, to put up a fight, and not be led like sheep to the shambles, which is exactly what happens when an untrained mob - and that is practically all we have to rely on to-day - is engaged in warfare. 
 
The press, in discussing our adverse trade balance recently, has suggested that the Government might think fit in the circumstances to reduce its estimates of expenditure. It is common knowledge that whenever there is a demand to cut down public expenditure, the defence vote is the first to be attacked. Owing possibly to war weariness and disillusionment, since the great war the advocacy of an adequate defence policy has not aroused any enthusiasm on the part of the majority of the people, and, consequently, those who preach the policy of preparedness for war and national self-reliance do not win many votes. The outlook today, however, is very black. 
 
Casting back our minds to the early days of July, 1914, we recall that Europe appeared at the time to bo slumbering, and all seemed peaceful. Yet, before the end of that month, war was upon us. And war will come upon us just as suddenly again. I suggest to the Government and the Senate that in this connexion we should do some hard thinking, and very carefully consider the position in which Australia stands to-day. I have studied this subject very seriously from the days of my youth, when I was a citizen soldier, and have always given much thought to it. The world situation to-day is appalling. Our own position, in relation to the supply of trained, or partially trained men and reserves of partially trained men on which we might draw, is woeful. Such supplies are practically non-existent. It is open to very grave doubt whether the surviving members of the Australian Imperial Force would be of very much use in the event of another outbreak. The youngest of them to-day must be somewhere about 40 years of age, whereas the maximum age for our first draft, if war came, would be 35. The majority of our returned soldiers are well over that age, and because of their war service are not the men they were. They might be useful in the training of others, but it is doubtful whether, in the event of another world' conflagration, we should be given an opportunity to train men. This is a matter of vital concern, and I appeal to the Senate to give it earnest considera tion. The Prime Minister  (Mr. Lyons)  and several other members of the Government are at present on the other side of the world, and, therefore, although I have prepared a lot of matter on this subject for submission to the Senate, I shall have to defer its use until we reassemble. 
 
The history of the world for the last 3,000 years shows that for every year of peace that has been enjoyed there have been 14 years of war. Notwithstanding the appalling loss of life and the magnitude of the expenditure which the last world conflagration involved, man, who is naturally a combative animal, has not yet learned his lesson. There are many people who preach the gospel that the best way to avoid war is to be absolutely unprepared for it - that war will not come if that policy be adopted. I entirely differ from that point of view, and I hope honorable senators will bear with me while I read some verses that expound a doctrine, which, in my opinion, we should adopt. The title of this poem, which was published in  The Navy,  is "" Peace with Honour "". It reads - "

The Government has introduced this bill as a measure of assistance to distressed farmers to help them recover from the position in which the slump in prices has placed them, despite their heroic efforts to carry on. The primary producers of Australia have contributed in no small measure to the partial recovery of Australia from the depression, and to the maintenance of Australia's credit during the depths of the depression. The States have not been inactive in providing relief. They have helped the farmers, by means of stay orders and protection certificates, to withstand pressure from their creditors, and they have also pro*vided advances for seasonal operations and sustenance to> enable the farmers to carry on from year to year. These measures do not, however, go to the root of the trouble - the debt burden is still there. The position of the farmer reminds me of the lines of Will Carleton, America's farmer poet- - "

- Even the very flags will come in time from Germany. These are facts stated by a man who cannot be called a labour advocate. Admiral Fremantle's leanings, if he has any, are more likely to be in favour of the Conservative than of the Labour Party, but he speaks out clearly and boldly on a question on which he should be an authority, and his words should have some weight with honorable senators like  Senator Dobson.  The Admiral gives figures which show the increase in the number of lascars employed. He shows that the number of lascars employed in 1S60 in the mercantile marine of Great Britain was only 335, and up to the year 1 900 the number had increased to no less than 36,023. That is surely an alarming rate of increase when we consider that, in the past, a very large number of Britishers found employment of a profitable kind in a seafaring life. The Admiral comments upon the figures in the following way :  - 
 
The increase of foreigners and lascars is very evident from these figures, but if we were to eliminate stewards, stewardesses, and other persons of nominal British nationality, we should probably find a far larger proportion than is shown above of the working crews to be composed of men not of British race. I have only space here, in concluding this part of my subject, to call attention to two papers by Commander Caborne, R.N.R., read before the Shipmasters' Congress in London in 1897- 1899 respectively,  Sir Charles  Dilke being in the chair, and to the discussions following the reading of the papers, in which men well acquainted with the mercantile marine took part. From these papers I take the following :  - Captain Froud, in the discussion on Commander Caborne's first paper, gives statistics of the crews of twentynine sailing vessels from various ports of England and the north of Europe. Of these he says that : "" Nearly 8 per cent of the officers, one-third of the petty officers, and rather morethan half of the other deck hands were foreigners. In two of the vessels, with the exception of two or three of the officers, the crews were all foreign."" Captain Blackmore, in the same discussion, says :  - "" It is quite possible for a set of foreigners to come over to this country, put up an office in Cornhill, buy ships and register them as private ship companies, and have masters and officers and seamen, without a British subject having anything to do with the matter ; and wo know that there are ships sailing under these conditions. They are not the slightest value to Britain as a nation, and all the money earned in them is carried away and spent in foreign countries."" 
 
Admiral Fremantle comments upon this in the following way :  - 
 
The statistics in certain ports abroad, such as theRiver Plate and San Francisco, are simply appalling. The missions to seamen have done good service for some years past in calling the attention of the Board of Trade to these subjects, and in endeavouring to supply the lack of good influences among British crews. Commander Caborne gives some interesting details as to how crews are supplied and got rid of. He tells us a shipmaster reports that the shipping agents of Baltimore put the crews on board at the last moment "" like prisoners,"" andyou takeyour chance as to whether they are "" tinkers, tailors, soldiers, or sailors "" Commander Caborne quotes letters which were read in the House of Commons from ship-managers to captains, as follows :  - "" Give your crew salt beef only, and keep them hard at work. They will never agree to forfeit."" . . . ""We should like you to get rid of as many more men as possible."" Naturally under such conditions men desert, and good men are scarce in the merchant service. We may well blush for such dealings, asRudyard Kipling, with his poetical insight, tells us. "" We may not speak of England, her flag's to sell or share. "" It is important to note that  Sir Charles  Dilke, in his concluding remarks on Commander Caborne's first lecture, said - ""lam a strong free-trader, but . . . we should not be prevented from taking measures which might, on any other grounds than national defence, savour of protection.""

I am bound to say that probably I ought to have repudiated the expression and answered the substance of the interjection in another way, but I used it in that fashion and to that extent. 1 regret that I adopted the phrase. My honorable and learned friend in the course of controversy tempted me. It was not an appropriate, expression to convey my meaning, and the use of it was susceptible of an idea of disparagement and reflection which, I am sure, was as far from my mind as it was from that of my honorable and learned friend. I am sure he will do me the justice of believing me when I say that I should be the last to use in regard to the British Navy - of which, whatever our views may be of this arrangement for defence, every Australian is proud - a term which could possibly be tortured, even by an adversary, into an expression of disrespect.

- Lord Selborne continued - 
 
The Australian Governments pay us a certain, contribution ; for this contribution we supply them with a certain article. Now this is good so far as it goes, but it does not go far enough. 
 
Now the only difference between the speechof the first Lord of the Admiralty, and that of the Governor of Victoria, lies in the fact that  Sir George  Sydenham Clarke's is themore eloquent, and does not contain any reference to Australia's naval contribution. A<< a gentleman aptly remarked the otherday, the lecturer was like the beggar at thecorner of a street, who. does not ask for alms, but holds out his hand. Let us for a moment consider the memorandum on "" Sea Power,."" and the principles involved in it. It deals with the importance of securing command of the sea, points to historical failures on the part of nations. through neglecting their naval power, and quotes historical successes by other nations which have adopted an opposite policy. It says - 
 
The command of the sea is determined by the result of great battles at sea..... those which led up to the defeat of the Armada, and those between the Dutch and English in the seventeenth century. ... It is immaterial where the great battle is fought, but wherever it may take place the result will be felt throughout the world. 
 
I invite honorable senators to read  Sir George  Clarke's lecture, and to observe that it contains reference to these very matters, only that it refers to them in a more eloquent way. The Governor's lecture traced the determining causes of the greatness of nations. England's greatness, he said, was undoubtedly due to the development of maritime power. He traced its naval history for some hundreds of years, referred to the Norman conquest, the fight between England and Spain, the Dutch wars, the naval battles with France, and the American revolution. The conclusion which he drew from his reading of history was that the best way to protect British commerce was by maintaining command of the sea. That command, he pointed out, could be retained only by being in a position to conduct an offensive campaign against an enemy's squadron. He quoted the state of the British over-sea trade, and also that of Australia. Looking back over a period of 650 years between the Roman invasion and the Norman Conquest, he traced the dominant influence of the naval force, and quoted two poets in support of his view - an anonymous one in the fifteenth century, and the poet Campbell who wrote in 1790.

The three vessels used as drill ships and one other vessel shall be manned by Australians and New Zealanders as far as procurable, paid at special rates, and enrolled in proportion to the population of the Commonwealth and New Zealand. 
 
The article goes on to provide that the ships shall be officered by officers of the Royal Navy, supplemented by officers of the Royal Naval Reserve. Article 6 provides for eight annual nominations for naval cadetships to be given to Australia, and two to Ne\y Zealand. It is within the knowledge of many honorable senators that this by no means represents all the Australian naval cadets who enter the British service yearly.

We are extremely indebted to the Imperial authorities for the protection of our mercantile marine. We must not judge our commerce by the exports from Australia to Great Britain, or by the imports from the old country ; we must recognise that the confidence given by the protection of the British Navy enables our ships to go to all parts of the world.

For the first ten years of the Commonwealth we are under the "" Braddon "" section of the Constitution, and the expenditure of the Commonwealth  is limited ; but at the end of that period, if we wish to be more extravagant in the way of naval expenditure, we shall have the opportunity. At present, however, we cannot afford more than we are asked to pay under the agreement. As to descents by privateers in the absence of the fleet, I take it that in these days of cable communication the home authorities will know very well from whence and when such descents are likely to be made ; at any rate they will be better informed on those points than we can be. The navy is not localized at home, but at the same time every vulnerable point is well protected. About 100 years ago there used to be Martello Towers along the coasts of Great Britain. These are now obsolete, but I well remember the lines from the poem  Ye Harmers qf England,  written by Thomas Campbell, himself a Scotchman, as follows : - "

-I am referring, sir, to the attempts made  by Mr.  Chamberlain to drag Australia and the other colonies into the Imperial net, and endeavouring to show how inimical to their interests it would be. What will be the next move in this grand game? This agreement will, I suppose, be entered into now, as I understand that the Bill commands a majority in the Senate, and it will continue in operation for ten years. At the end of that time an increased subsidy will be asked for ; Australia will say "" We shall not contribute anything more towards the cost of the navy unless we are to be allowed to have a voice in its management."" That is the very thing which  Mr. Chamberlain  wants. Honorable senators have all read, I suppose, the little poem about the spider and the fly- ""Will you walk into my parlour""? said the spider to the fly. 
 
In this case  Mr. Chamberlain  is the spider, who is weaving the Imperial web very cunningly. The threads are so finely spun that a great number of our people do not see them. "" Well,"" Australia says to Great Britain, "" we shall not pay you any more subsidy unless we get a voice in the management of the navy.""

The fight to-day is between one form of imperialism and another, and I am not much interested in it. While there may be some degree of idealism in what i3 described as the American way of life, I know that Stalinism cannot be beaten by trying to preserve monopoly capitalism. There is only one organization that can beat Stalinism. If the democracies want to succeed in Europe, they should enlist the aid of the Social Democrats in Germany instead of propping up the German war lords once again, just as they are propping up the Japanese war lords. Ten thousand Japanese politicians, admirals and generals have been "" de-purged ""  by  General MacArthur. That action played right into the hands of Stalin. It is the sort of thing that the Communists exploitAmerica to-day is an imperialistic nation. If I had to choose between Russian imperialism and American imperialism, I. should probably lean towards the latter because, in spite of ""Jim  Crowism  "", at least it envisages some measure of democracy; but American imperialism will never beat Russian imperialism unless the Americans alter their tactics. Recently, a motion was moved in the United Nations Assembly to set up a committee to inquire into the Indian problem in South Africa. Although the motion was only for the setting up of a committee, the Australian representative voted against it and was the only British Commonwealth delegate to do so. Do honorable senators opposite believe that we can win the Chinese over to our side by such methods? I regret to say that the Labour party, too, has done some things that do not stand to its credit. We must show the coloured peoples that we have a real living faith - something better than they have. I do not believe that savage man has reached his present state of development only to destroy himself. I believe that man will, to a large degree, control nature, not for the purpose of  exterminc.  ting fellow men but for the purpose of lessening physical labour, and of developing his mind so that he may know something of the work of the poets, and of literature, painting, art, and music. That is what we should be doing instead of saying, "" You, Russians are barbarians. We are going to beat you with the atom bomb "". If .an atomic bomb were dropped on Russia to-night, Russia would overrun Germany and France within a month, and we should be compelled to bomb the French and the Germans also. . If we exterminate every Russian, where do we go from there? Germany and Russia would be desolated, and we would call the aftermath "" peace "". But the last position would be worse than the first. I hope that we shall retreat politically in Korea, that there will be a neutral zone established, and that the people who really love peace will say, "" A plague o: both your houses "". Australia must rouse itself from the terrible apathy that exists in this country, and in most other countries. Nationalism breeds supernationalism. Because a man is of a different colour, we are prone to think that he is inferior to us, although there is no scientific basis for that opinion. Because the pigment of his skin is different from ours, we say that inherently we have a greater capacity than he has. Those precepts built on racial prejudice have forced one nation against the other. The time has come when the human race must either exterminate itself or go forward to an era which even the most optimistic of us has never envisaged. It is for us to choose to-day whom we shall serve. "

- No. Money wa9 appropriated for the work and the Labour Government called for the supply of materials, but this Government has neglected the job. Similar disgraceful conditions exist at Mount Hawthorn, and the position at Subiaco is worse. The men at Subiaco are not provided with a recreation room or even a lunch room. Access to their workroom is gained by an alleyway that is not wide enough to permit comfortable passage for a man of my size. Those are the conditions under which men whom Government supporters criticize are working to the best of their ability. The staffs at Fremantle, Cottesloe and the depot in Brisbanestreet, Perth, are similarly handicapped. I urge the Government to rectify this shocking state of affairs. The men have suffered considerable hardships during the summer months, but their situation will become worse as the coldest period of the winter approaches. If the Government is not prepared to have the work done in the interests of the men, at least it ought to have it undertaken in the interests of efficiency and economy. The installation of proper offices and amenities would effect a saving by the reduction of sick leave alone, and the health of the men and their families would improve considerably. These skilled technicians are worth looking after, not only because such men are scarce, but also because they are willing and efficient workers. 
 
I regret that the proposed appropriation provides only for the bare requirements of essential services. The Government has not made any attempt to finance any of the developmental undertakings that it promised the people that it would initiate. The appropriation will enable the Government only to pay its wages bill. Between now and the time when the budget is presented, nothing further will be done. Prices will continue to spiral, but no action will be taken by the Government. Honorable senators opposite laugh, but they would not laugh if they were on the basic wage. They remind me of what was said by a poet - "" He  grinneth  a lot, but he is still a rogue "". 
 
I turn now to the position of trainees under the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. The question of their conditions and allowances was receiving the attention of the Chifley Government before the last general election. In 1945, trainees received an allowance of £3 15s. a week, and that was subsequently increased by 15 per cent. These young exservicemen and women are being rehabilitated and taught trades so that they may become useful citizens. A tradesman is an asset to the country. They are trying to exist on the miserable pittance that they are getting at the present time - £3 15s. a week. Some of them have wives and children. "

- I consider that if one wished to be brief, that version of the poem would suffice as a. speech on the budget. But I wish to refer again to the position that wool-growers are in. At the last general election, the present Government parties promised the people that, if they were returned, they would, among other things, end shortages, reduce prices and introduce legislation to provide for ballots in trade unions. Did the Government conduct a ballot of wool-growers before it announced its iniquitous scheme for the prior payment of income tax by wool-growers? I have not heard of a ballot being conducted at which the woolgrowers of Australia, gave the Treasurer  (Mr. Fadden)  authority to use their money - and it is their money that he proposes to use. The simple fact is that the Government was faced with the prospect of a budget deficit of £103,000,000, and the only means which it could think of to balance the budget was to dip into the pockets of the wool-growers and take from them in advance taxes to an amount of £103,000,000. If the Government considers that proposal to be fair, the ethics of taxation and balancing budgets have taken a peculiar turn since the Labour party surrendered the reins of office. 
 
Honorable senators opposite have refrained from referring to the promises that they made in relation to preventive medicine and diagnostic clinics. I have not heard of one Commonwealth diagnostic clinic being established in the last eleven months, so, without doubt, the promise that such clinics would be established was only a bribe to get votes. The Government parties believe that votes should be won. by all possible means, even by pulling the wool over the eyes of the people. This Government could aptly be described as the "" wool-gatherer's government "". It pulled the wool over the eyes of the general public of Australia last December, and now it is pulling wool out of the bales of the wool-growers and using it to balance the budget.

             - by leave - I feel that I ought to say something on this occasion because of the very kind remarks that have been made about me this afternoon. I particularly thank the Minister for Trade and Customs 
 
I remember an occasion when a Premier of Queensland was being honoured. The assembled gathering sang "" For He's a Jolly Good Fellow "". When the song had finished, the Premier said, "" Gentlemen, this is not the first time that that song has been sung to me. Usually I tell ray private secretary to make a note of all those who are not singing "" ! I have been assured this afternoon, and I accept the assurance with humility and gratitude, that all honorable senators present agree with the sentiments that have been expressed. I remember another occasion when a man was being honoured. The gathering said some very nice things of him, sang, ""For He's a Jolly Good Fellow "" and generally expressed some very agreeable sentiments. When he came to reply, he said, "" Gentlemen, I do not believe that I am as good as you have said I am, and I am quite certain that I am not as bad as most of you are thinking I am""! I do not feel that way this afternoon. 
 
I said on the 8th March that I would not speak again in this chamber, but this speech has been forced upon me. I believe that all members of Commonwealth and State Parliaments and municipalities in this country have, in these days, an unusual responsibility. We have to do the ordinaryeveryday things that must be done. We must assemble here, take part in debates and do our best to raise the standard of comfort of the people of this wonderful country. But I emphasize that the developments that are now taking place in the world must bring home to all of us a new lesson. The world to-day is not the world with which we have been acquainted during most of our lifetime. It is an entirely new world, in which scientists are developing methods of destroying human life that were previously beyond our comprehension. The scientists say that the tremendous engines of destruction that they are developing may be used for industrial purposes and be of immense benefit to mankind. The question is whetherwe are going to use them for destruction or construction. It seems to me that that imposes upon every one of us a new and greater responsibility. 
 
In conclusion, I shall recite a poem that I learned some years ago. It is - "

- I believe it is. What has been the attitude in the past of those who are now embracing the cause of trade unionism? I remember that, in my earlier years, we were told that the industrial trouble that was. occurring then was due to the actions of agitators, and that the trade union movement would be an excellent movement if only it would rid itself of the agitators, who were stirring up strife. They went on to jobs, saw the conditions under which men were working, and tried to improve them. Speaking from soap boxes, they asked the workers whether they intended to submit to those conditions. They made- some very  inflamatory  speeches. They talked revolution. Henry Lawson, one of the greatest of Australian poets, wrote of and predicted a bloody revolution. Others besides myself have been inspired by his poetry. If he were alive to-day and wrote poems such as  Faces in the Street,  the power and majesty of the law, through pimps and stooges, would be invoked against him, and he would be declared under this measure. There was a time when trade union officials were denied access to men on the job. They had to sneak round corners, meet men as they came away from their work and establish contact with them by all kinds of subterfuges so that they could form trade unions. The employers said that trade unions were all right, except for the agitators. Now it is said that strikes are inspired by the Communists in. our midst. I wonder how many Communists there were in the old Australian Workers Union or the Shearers Union in the 18909. I wonder how many Communists there were then in the coal miners' unions. "

- 1 rise to support the motion proposed by  Senator Keeffe  and to indicate that the matter in question is. .so urgent that we impress upon the Government that it should use the same speed and take such effective measures as were adopted to protect the interests of MLC Ltd. Public interest in the protection of the waters of the north is substantial. I learned from two files which I obtained from the Parliamentary Library that there is a tremendous amount of material in periodicals and newspapers supporting our stand. If the people in the south of Australia are interested in this matter, especially the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, how much more interested must be the people who. live in the north - the people whose economic future depends upon the development of the area? 
 
Let me deal first with the Great Barrier Reef. The protection of the Reef is a matter not only of national interest but also of international interest because, as has been indicated, it is a wonder of the world. Honourable senators on both sides of the chamber have indicated support for the proposition that the Reef should be protected. However, the initiative must be taken quickly. There are complicated and varying views on the legality of- any such action on the part of Australia. The Melbourne Age' of 27th August 1968 carried an article on this subject under the heading 'Doubts on Ability to Protect Reef. The article was in these terms: .  
 
Australia's competence to safeguard trie Great Barrier Reef was in serious question overseas and some form of international control had been suggested. 
 
Australian poet and conservationist Judith Wright said this in Townsville on her return from « 20-eountry 5-month trip to Europe, UK and Asia for talks with world conservation authorities. 
 
Miss Wright said all scientists and conservationists she spoke to were well informed on the threat lo the Reef posed by negligence, lack of scientific knowledge and prospecting and mining activities. . . . But they had grown increasingly concerned over the apparent lack of government policy lo guarantee preservation of the Great Barrier Reef in its natural state and the lag in scientific study of the Reef. 
 
I emphasise the next part of the article: 
 
They made the point that the Great Barrier Reef is not part of Australia, not really in Australian waters', said Miss Wright. 
 
If this is an international question, then it is important that something be done immediately by the Australian Government lo determine the legality of our claims to control the area. The suggestion of my Party is that we should take the initiative, exercise supervision and control over the whole area, and then place the matter before the International Court. We make that suggestion in the international interest, not merely in the national interest. "

- I wish to refer to the provision for the embassy in the Kingdom of Greece, and should like to bring the Department up to date. In doing so, I propose to refer briefly to certain events. On 21st April 1967 a military coup took place in Greece. The coup was swift, well planned and practically bloodless. Having seized power, the militaryjunta stated that it had acted to save the country from an impending Communist revolution. Subsequently the junta proclaimed its aim of rejuvenating Greece, which had allegedly become degenerate under parliamentary rule. It will be recalled that the military coup occurred shortly before the Greek general elections in which most observers had predicted a sweeping victory by George Papandreou's Centre Union, a reform party of moderates opposed both to the extreme right and extreme left. 
 
Since coming to power the junta has suspended parliament, gaoled some 6,500 political opponents, banned all political parties, banned public meetings, terminated civil and personal liberties guaranteed by the 1952 constitution and imposed a rigorous Press censorship. About one thousand books have been banned, including works of modern Greek authors, chiefly historians, novelists and poets. I mention this because the point I am making is that we no longer have a Kingdom of Greece and the wisdom of the expenditure proposed under this head can be questioned. Even the Greek classics are not safe. Plays by Aristophanes, Euripedes and Sophocles have been compulsorily dropped from theatrical repertoirs in order allegedly to protect the moral, spiritual, artistic and cultural standards of the Greek people.

- I am speaking about the red telephones. I admit that they are less likely to be damaged than are public telephones in suburban areas. There is less likelihood of poets writing on the walls of the telephone booths because there are no telephone booths. That is the major form of damage to public telephone booths. It has always been a problem. If one makes representations to the Postmaster-General to have a telephone installed on a particular street corner he is told that there is one within 200 or 300 years and that it costs too much to install a new telephone. I sympathise with that point of view but I cannot understand why the two companies that control the red telephones get all the cream. Why are they given the chosen parts of the  city for their telephones? I have mentioned hotels. The same remarks apply to big department stores. For many years they provided additional telephones as a service to the public but now someone else has horned in. If that is not a case of the Post Office providing unnecessary competition for itself, I do not know what it is. 
 
Is the Post Office considering handing over some of its technical sections to private enterprise? We would have reason for grave concern if it were. Is the Government considering winding up the Post Office? I hope it is not. The Government could quite easily hand over other sections of the Post Office to private enterprise. What about postage stamps? If the Post Office can get away with handing over its telephone services, what is to stop it handing over its stamps? "

I have heard it said that if parliament house were built on Capital Hill 70 feet of soil would have to be taken off the top. Id discussing this matter with some of the newer members of the Parliament I find that they are not aware that a great deal of soil was brought in to form the site on the lakeside which is now proposed for parliament house. I maintain that if that amount of soil has been brought in to make that site suitable, soil could be brought in to build up the area of the top of Capital Hill so that the present level could be maintained, or even raised. Less soil would be required to be brought in to bring the site up to the required level than would have to be taken away to lower the level by the 70 feet that has been mentioned. There is very little more to be said. I certainly will be casting my vote in favour of Capital Hill, but in appealing once again to those who have yet to declare their thinking I should like to be emotional for a moment. I am not ashamed to be emotional on this issue.I believe it is one in which we arc looking forward for many, many years - many centuries. I hope - making a decision for all future Australians. In order to stress the point at issue I should like to read a poem, with a few paraphrased lines in it. It is called 'Australia - Land of the Future', and it reads: "

               - Mr Acting Deputy President. I have been most impressed by the eloquence, the enthusiasm and the poetry of this debate on the subject of the site for the new and permanent parliament house. Perhaps it is fitting for honourable senators to give expression to their aesthetic and other views on something that not only can become a thing of beauty but also can turn into an object that might bring criticism on this generation if we do not make the right decision. lt does not fall often to the lot of 184 people to make such a decision as this. Parliament houses unfortunately are too rare throughout the world. Perhaps our world would be a better place if many more parliament houses were to be found in a greater number of countries. We have the honour and privilege to live in this country where the institution of parliament is accepted. We accept the history and the traditions of Parliament. I think that most of us, after listening to the debates on this matter, are seised of the great importance of perpetuating and, if possible, enriching these traditions and the status of Parliament. So, I take it as a great honour to be one of the senators in this chamber and to be one of the members of this Parliament in this period in the history of Australia. 
 
We have the responsibility of making up our own minds about choosing a site for the new and permanent parliament house. I feel that we need  to  draw on our best resources in order to be able to have a good long look into the future to determine what is involved in the decision that we are to make. For a start, we can take the material decision that on Capital Hill we have 130 acres of land that, without very much difficulty, engineers could turn into whatever shape they wished. In the days of Walter Burley Griffin, it would have been a horse, cart and barrow job to do anything with Capital Hill. That was the means of moving earth in those days. Even an imagination of the greatest elasticity would boggle at the thought of moving that hill with horses, carts and barrows. Yet, today, with modern equipment, this would be a matter of ease. With the equipment available in Australia the whole of Capital Hill could be moved down to water level. "

-  I have no doubt that, if it suits the Opposition, honorable senators opposite will produce it. What we want in the National Parliament is not the statements of pressure groups, but a fair presentation of the facts so that we can reach a proper conclusion. Nobody can be 100 per cent, perfect, and I concede that although our present rate of unemployment is only one-half of 1 per cent., there must be patches in various parts of the country which it is- difficult- to get at. We are not 100 per cent, perfect, but I claim that we are pretty close to it. One does not have to rely on poetic licence to arrive at the conclusion that, if one one-half of 1 per cent, of our work force is in receipt of the unemployment benefit, 99.5 per cent, of the people who live and work in Australia are enjoying comparatively prosperous conditions. 
 
V/e have to look at this matter on a wide front.  Senator O'Byrne  has apparently taken exception to my contention that it is wrong to create a scare. We know that nothing succeeds like success. As a nation, figuratively speaking, we have put our hands to the plough to do certain things. We have committed ourselves to a situation in which we contemplate increasing our work force by some 60,000 persons each year by natural increase and immigration. Above all things, if we are to progress, we must not lack confidence to carry our task through to a successful conclusion. During the period of seven and one-half years that this Government has been in office, there has been practically no unemployment in Australia. Why, almost on the eve of the presentation of the budget, bearing in mind our record, has the Opposition seen fit to create these scares and so make our task more difficult? 
 
As I said previously, during the last twelve months the number of persons in receipt of the unemployment benefit has increased from 9,164 to 20,491. It must not be forgotten that, during the same period, about 60,000 immigrants have come to Australia. We have to face the situation that, during the last twelve months, the demand for labour has not increased commensurately with the increase of the work force. "

I suggest that considerationbe given to some scheme along the lines I have mentioned to afford assistance to the aged sick. Could not we help provide something in the way of flats or cottages with easy access to our large hospitals so that the aged sick could be given particular care and, indeed, not have to stray away from a loved one for ages? They could have care and attention at home from their partner andreceive necessary treatment from the hospital at regular intervals. If we can get a better appreciation of the needs of aged people through those people who work so closely with them in the fields of medicine, social work, religious activities and science, and if we do what we can to help them in all ways, then we will have made a very worthwhile contribution.

-  Honorable senators are laughing. It does not matter to them. They are all right and they are satisfied, but these unfortunate people, the pensioners, are not organized. They are incapable of speaking for themselves as an organized body, and the Government has no respect for them. The organized bodies of workers who are capable of withholding their labour power, and of challenging the Government as it should be challenged, get more consideration. The Government will yield to physical pressure, but it will not yield in the slightest to what might be called dialectical pressure. 
 
The Government puts into words the terms and conditions under which the aged people are to be treated and the way they are to be buried. The Government would bury them as paupers, just as it would bury a mongrel dog. It shows no response at all unless it is faced with organized physical pressure which I have advocated through the years. I feel that I should tell the Government these things. I cannot imagine anything more appropriate to the occasion than the lines by that well known Scottish poet, Robert Burns -

I noticed this advertisement and I was a little puzzled, because at first glance it did seem that it conflicted with what I had said. However, a careful reading of the advertisement shows that the airline's claim that it is now carrying more passengers than before may well be right without being in conflict with my own statement. The advertisement refers to Australia and Papua and New Guinea. Statistics relating to Papua and New Guinea have been included in air traffic figures only in quite recent times. Therefore, it is possible that the absolute figure is greater, but my own statement relating to traffic growth remains as it was - quite correct. I have no harsh criticism to offer.

The womanless communities of the Australian bush set very high store upon womenfolk, as the historian shows. It was not only the American Marines who held the view that there is nothing like a dame. The bush women in Australia were held in tremendous respect and properly idolized. I think it was the Australian poetess 
 
Dorothea Mackellar who immortalized them when she wrote - 
 
Fur love they faced the wilderness, the women of the west. 
 
The men took that attitude and they placed the women, as I said earlier in my remarks, on a pedestal - on a plane to which women were never exalted at any other time or in any other place. Men looked to marriage to provide comfort, companionship and children rather than to satisfy a romantic or erotic spirit. Oddly enough, the scientists tell us, the men of the 19th century in Australia were a little shy and a little ashamed of romantic feelings. They felt that it was a little ungentlemanly to indulge in the romantic and the erotic. They tended very largely to limit their conversation amongst themselves to matters of a strictly masculine character. They frowned on any tendency to allow such women as came to the bush to mix generally in male society. "

. -  I move - 
 
That the bill be now read a second time. 
 
Honorable senators are requested to consider a bill now presented to amend the Customs Act 1901-1957. This bill deals with various aspects of customs but its main provisions are in the interests of work simplification. It proposes to abolish declarations on certain entries; to simplify the appointment of wharfs under the act and the licensing of carriages used in the movement of under bond cargo. It also introduces a new concept for documentation in the removal of customable goods; it supplies the legislative backing for simplification of drawback procedures and it removes unnecessary requirements of the act which are now outmoded by modern-day practice. In addition, it proposes to give certain rights to customs agents in the matter of the suspension or -cancellation .of their licences. The powers of the customs in regard to the production .of genuine invoices are strengthened .by .this bill, and it provides authority for an .officer .of .customs or police to arrest, without warrant, a person who the customs or .police officer has reasonable grounds for believing has assaulted an officer in the .execution of his duties. It also makes certain .minor machinery amendments .to the .existing act. 
 
Under section 155 of the Customs Act declarations must be made on certain customs entries as to the correctness of the details shown on the entry. In accordance with the Government's policy to simplify procedures as much as possible, it has been decided to dispense with 'the requirement that declarations be made on certain entries and to make a simpler provision for the identification of -the person making the entry and assuming responsibility as to its correctness. 
 
Section 15 of the Customs Act requires wharfs to be appointed within the limits of ports. Modern wharf building programmes extend wharfs for some distance on to land. Limits of ports are usually defined on high water marks and, in consequence, when appointing new wharfs it has been necessary to re-proclaim the limits of the port. The present bill will enable wharfs to be appointed whether or not they are within .the poet limits. A considerable amount of detailed administrative work will be saved by this measure. "

Indeed, to tens of thousands of Chinese people, death is far preferable to living under this stern and tyrannical rule.

I urge the Government not to be stampeded into any reduction  of  the quotas that it has decided upon. I point to the Snowy Mountains scheme, and if I were tempted to become poetic, 1 might describe it as the fulfilment of a vision splendid. I remind the Senate that 80 per cent, of the  worK  force of that undertaking has been supplied by new Australians. Having regard to the accomplishments of new Australians in relation to that scheme and other projects throughout Australia, we must admit that they are playing a magnificent part in the development of this country. The Government should resist the suggestion thai, because there is a pocket of unemployment here or there, due to seasonal conditions or other unfortunate happenings, its immigration policy should be reviewed. I say to the Government that I believe its policy is the right and courageous one, and that no other would satisfy our needs. "

. -  This controversial clause was referred to, not only during the secondreading debate on this bill, but also during the Budget debate. The effect of the clause is to increase from £300 to £400 the allowable taxation deduction for superannuation contributions and life assurance premiums. On two occasions, the Minister has said that 25,000 taxpayers in Australia will be affected, and he has agreed that, as a proportion of the 3,850,000 taxpayers in Australia, that is not a large number. I should like the Minister to tell me how  he  arrives at the figure of 25,000. Are we to infer from the Minister's remarks that already 25,000 people in Australia are paying more than £300 a year in superannuation contributions and life assurance premiums, or did he mean that he assumes that 25,000 people, having regard to their incomes, will be able further to invest in this way? Or is it a bit of each? I do not know how the Minister has arrived at the figure of 25,000. I was rather amazed when the Minister referred to these people as the salt of the earth and said that through theirown effort they were providing for their own future. To me he seemed to underline the fact that they were providing for their own future. It appears that because they can provide for their own future the Government then says in effect,  ""We  will give you a helping hand"". It seems that the old poem "" Our paths grow wider as the seasons creep "" is the approach of the Liberal Party in helping a particular bracket of people in contrast to the attitude of the Labour Party. 
 
I think the normal human approach would be that if these people were able to provide for themselves whether it be through their ability, their good fortune or their good health or because of any other circumstances in this fair country of Australia, we should say, "" Congratulations to you, we are glad to see it "", but surely the Australian people should not be expected to make their path any easier.

.- I wish to speak to the proposals to amend clauses 15 and 38 by inserting paragraph (bb) in each case. I acknowledge with gratitude that the Government proposes to insert paragraph (ba) in each of those clauses, but I should like the Minister to explain to me whether the term "" government "" has any legal definition in the Acts Interpretation Act, or what the legal significance of it is. Passing now to the provision which deals with the home, it will be recalled that when we were discussing, under this bill, the rules for the assessment of the family's compensation in the event of the death of a passenger by air, the view was put during the debate that, having regard to the limitation of the amount to be recovered to £7,400, it was specially necessary that there should not be taken into account, thereby reducing the family's recovery, property that accrued to the family by virtue of the will or intestacy of the deceased breadwinner. The attention of the Minister was directed to a provision in the Tasmanian Fatal Accidents Act which excluded from reckoning as a deduction from the widow's recovery so much of the deceased's estate as did not exceed £5,000. 
 
The Minister was good enough, after his officers had made some research in the matter, to state to the Senate that Tasmania had the honour of being the only State in which such a remedial exception had been introduced. The Minister and his colleagues in the House of Representatives have had those provisions before them and have had the opportunity to consider them. I express my dismay that the amendment that is now brought before us is cast in the unsatisfactory form in which it is presented. 
 
I first comment on the complete inappropriateness, in my opinion, of the term "" acquisition "". I invite the Minister - and I am not hastening unduly, so that those at his elbow will have the advantage of the delay between syllables - to produce any textbook authority, or any statute or legal language whatsoever, that uses the term "" acquisition "" in relation to transmission of property on the death of a deceased person. That is, I expect that any court to-day taking the provision in hand would realize that the statute has to be construed. I do not think that the inappropriateness of the expression would defeat the purpose, but I ask why we deliberately depart from the terms of recognized connotation to create doubt, indefiniteness and ambiguity. However, that is only a preliminary observation and is not of great consequence. What I wish to submit in regard to the contents of the amendment is of great consequence, in my submission. 
 
What the amendment proposes to exclude from being taken into account as a deduction,  Mr. Chairman,  is an interest in a dwelling house used at any time as the home of that spouse or child, or the household contents acquired by her in consequence of the decease. I can think of widows whose homes are worth £50,000 - in a case where they occupy a curtilage in the city containing a castle - which would come clearly within the definition of a dwelling. But if I go into suburban lands I can see farmlets where castles have been erected on fourteen acres of land. In the spirit of the lines from the poet - looking upon it as the owner of all I survey - in that expansive moment I would regard the whole of the area as my home. Certainly the amendment refers to "" dwelling "", but how much of the area around it is included in the case of a farmlet? The value of some of those properties will go into five figures. 
 
But the widow, for whom I speak on this occasion, is one who occupies a humble cottage as a tenant, whose husband had the misfortune of investing £5,000 or £6,000 of his savings in Commonwealth stock after listening to the advice of a government. In that situation the language that has been chosen, deliberately different from the Tasmanian provision., creates a discrimination between the widow who inherits the castle and the widow-tenant whose husband was ill-advised enough to invest, not in a home, but in shares and stocks, now worth only a few thousand valueless pounds. She is excluded from the benefit of this provision. 
 
It is little wonder,  Mr. Chairman,  that I rise here with a degree of resentment. After deliberate and well-conducted debate for a whole week, I find that an obvious injustice such as is apparent on this language, persists. 
 
And then, why have the words "" at any time "" been introduced? If the expression were confined to a dwelling used as the home at the time of death, it would have some relation to reason. But,  Mr. Chairman,  I invite the Minister to contest the suggestion that is impressed on my mind on the first reading of the language, that a case such as this would attract a deduction, If, in the last ten years before a husband met his death in an aircraft disaster, he had moved every two years - he moved through five households, each of which was used as his home - each home that was acquired in the terms of this incongruous and inappropriate language, typical of this place, would be included. If I mistake not, the singular includes the plural. Why should a succession of five dwelling houses used as homes at any time be taken into account to effect a reduction? I put these matters with deliberation and indefiniteness only for the purpose of evoking an explanation. I am dismayed. "

Literature censorship which, I hope, will remain for a long time, is, as I have said, handled by the Department of Customs and Excise under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations. Many people fail to realize that as a Commonwealth Government we have no constitutional power whatever to ban books. We have no jurisdiction over anything that is printed in Australia, and we use our power under the regulations to deal only with literature imported into this country. The question of whether we should have literature censorship will always provoke a very lively debate in any company, but it is not without significance to remind honorable senators that in 1644, over 300 years ago, that great champion of the freedom of the press and that great opponent of censorship, John Milton, poet and pamphleteer, made this statement in one of his pamphlets - "

- There will be a testing time soon and the honorable senator and his Party will bite the dust as they have bitten it on every other occasion. 
 
The next question is as to whether or not we should send national service trainees to Vietnam. Surely to goodness people do not think that this is done without being forced into this position. We have responsibilities there. I have said at least three or four times already that we have as much at stake as, or more at stake than, the United States, lt is just as simple as that. We have not sufficient men in our Regular Army for the commitment that we have to stand up to in Vietnam. As a consequence, we have to send a proportion of our national service trainees to assist the Regular Army. I know that there is some criticism about sending these fellows to Vietnam while not giving them a vote. I remind the Senate that they are not called up until they have passed their twentieth birthday. By the time the training is undertaken and they are eventually put into this area the vast majority of them will be old enough to receive a vote. The other day one body gave as only 1 per cent, the proportion of those who would be unable to vote when they reached Vietnam. I am not suggesting that that figure is correct. I have heard another estimate that 95 per cent, of them would be eligible to vote by the time they got into that area. This is the position: We have not sufficient trained men and we have no option but to send our national servicemen. In my opinion, these lads will willingly carry out the responsibility that is to be placed on them. 
 
If we value our liberty and our standard of living, surely they are worth some sacrifice. This has been the pattern throughout history. Sacrifices are never distributed evenly no matter what persons or governments might do. Unfortunately, it always falls upon some to make heavier sacrifices than others. I cannot see any way out of that. If we say that Australia is not worth this sacrifice, we are saying in the popular vernacular that it is not worth two bob. If it is worth anything to us, we must be prepared to make sacrifices. Some will say that it is all right for fellows like me to say that the other man can make the sacrifice but it has fallen to the lot of some of us at least to offer to make sacrifices in the defence of Australia. I see many who have done so in this Senate. I remind honorable senators of a poem written many years ago- "

- lt has to tender. I put it to the Government that there has been far too long a delay and it is a miracle of patience on the part of everybody in Tasmania that the application remains alive in view of that delay. The decision is outmoded. I heard  Senator Devitt  put the argument that a shipbuilding industry is badly needed for defence. The need for it ought lo he acknowledged by those at top Government level who are advocating today - following Labour policy - the need for an Australian overseas shipping line. The prospects of shipbuilding in Australia were never better. As the Minister himself acknowledged. the value of ships built last year was §29 million. The value in the year before was $19 million. So there was a tremendous improvement. Associated shipowners are talking of building container vessels. Containers are being built. Oil rigs are being required for operations out in the sea. A vast area is opening up in activity for ships. Quite obviously the Government lacks confidence and all faith in the development of this country. The Tariff Board, in the report to which we have been referred, said - 
 
By world standards the Australian shipbuilding industry is very small. 
 
Surely in any economy that wants to have a proper spread, particularly in an island continent so heavily dependent on shipping, so grossly at the mercy of overseas shipowners, we should round off our economy with a vigorous, thriving and developing shipbuilding industry. 
 
I can well understand that it is proper for the Government, looking at the shipbuilding industry in Australia today, to ask how this will affect the employment of other shipbuilding yards. That is quite a proper inquiry, but it is certainly not the only one. The Government must look at defence. It must look at the whole of the economy. It must look at the position of a State that most badly needs an industry of this kind, as Tasmania does. What is proposed is not merely to build ships, but commencing with 10,000 to 15,000 tonners in the first instance to go on, in the second place, to build ships and tankers up to 55,000 and 60,000 tons. This would be a major industry that would also expand exports. This company is world wide. Nothing can be said against it from the viewpoint of efficiency or finance, or on any other count at all. It is wanted in many parts of the world. If we say "" no "", these people, as was said in Longel low's poem - "

.- I do not think any Commonwealth governments have ever settled down to solving the problem of how to make it easy for Commonwealth and State public servants to contest seats in Parliament. I do not think they have ever been fully alive to the handicap which confronts Commonwealth and State public servants when they first entertain the idea of entering the Senate or the House of Representatives. If they continue to occupy their positions in the Public Service after nomination day, then, as  Senator Devitt  has pointed out, they run the risk, in the case of their being elected, of losing their seats. That is one legal opinion that I have received. 
 
If they are elected to the House of Representatives, they are able to take their seats and their names go, not on a wages record but on an allowance sheet, and they are paid from that date. But the position is vastly different with a senator. If a Senate election were held in December, a successful senator could not take his seat in the Senate until 1st July of the following year. So there is a period through which he must live as best he can. If he has certain skills, of course the problem of employment does not arise. On the other hand, if he has not, he could be faced with a period of difficulty.

In this respect I refer to Division No. 400, subdivision 3, item 03. Recently  Mr. Donald  McLean, the  Chairman  of the Management Committee of the Australian Society of Authors, and Miss Jill Hellyer, the Secretary of the Society, wrote to all members of the Parliament setting out a case for an urgent inquiry into the state of letters and the arts in Australia. 
 
They pointed out that a considerable proportion of the annual budget of $66,000 goes to literary pensions. They stated that the fact that the Commonwealth Literary Fund has to turn down proposals which it grants in the following year shows that its funds to support the writing of books are completely inadequate. They pointed out also that the policy of the fund of guaranteeing authors of the less paying types of books, such as books of poetry as opposed to novels, has resulted in reduced opportunities since publishers are now unwilling to publish unless the writer gets a guarantee. In the letter the writers pointed to the great and overwhelming difference between the niggardly treatment of Australian authors by the Commonwealth Literary Fund and the arrangements existing in Great Britain, Canada, France, Holland, Sweden and many other countries. 
 
Frankly, I believe that the way to establish a national culture is by proper encouragement of professional authors and poets. Australia is being badly left behind in this regard. It is time that Australia got on the march and did something to encourage its writers, who can create and publish abroad a national Australian image. The present system -of patronising the organisations to which I have referred certainly is a piecemeal and higgledy-piggledy one. It is frustrating the efforts of those who could put Australia on the world literary map. 
 
To say the least, the present system is just not good enough. Therefore, on behalf of all artists I make a plea that the Commonwealth institute a general inquiry into the plight of people to see whether more assistance, over and above the assistance that is made available to them- now, could be given. As 1 have said, the present arrangement is just not good enough. There certainly is an urgent need for an inquiry into the state of arts and letters in Australia. I particularly draw the Minister's attention to the large increase in the appropriation made available to the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust. I ask the Minister to specifically answer the questions that 1 have posed in that regard. "

             Senator Turnbull made great play of the fact that this Senate was a States House and not a party House. Well, let us all subscribe to that view. Let it not be only the idea of a few. Do not lel this be a States House when it is politically popular to be on the side of a State. It is very easy to be on the bandwagon and to get on to the popular side of things. But not all of us are expected by the people who elect us to be political sycophants of one industry or another merely for political gain. They expect us to be capable of analysing the pros and cons of a case. They do not expect us just to go along voting for one thing or another merely because of the political gain that can bc obtained from taking that course. 
 
I would like to say,  Mr. President  - and I say this with all the sincerity at my disposal - that the speech by 
 
I have examined the Agreement and the Bill that we are discussing now. I was reminded somewhat of line in the poem "" ' We'll all be rooned ', said Hanrahan."" It continues to this effect: "" ' If it rains, we'll have floods. If it does not rain, we will have bushfires. In any case we'll all be rooned. "" Do not let us anticipate the difficulties. Those who are likely to suffer any difficulties can take comfort, I am sure, in the knowledge that the Agreement contains provisions for some action to be taken in the event of their industry being adversely affected. Surely between two sister dominions, some further agreement can be made before destruction has taken place.  Senator Lawrie  made a good point. I think it was the first time that I had heard it in the debate. He said that the tariffs were not to be summarily dismissed with a sweep of the hand; there is to be a gradual reduction. This is a good point indeed. It shows that mature consideration and thought have been given to this matter. A limitation on the import of pig meats, and cheese has been included in the Agreement also. I think the pea and bean growers of Tasmania would be well advised to accept the advice and the counsel of the Minister for Trade and Industry "

- With great respect, none has anything to do with the provisions of the Bill, but they are nonetheless interesting for that. They ranged through matters such as how many people are employed - which is quite different from how how they are appointed - and I agree that they are matters proper for consideration of this Parliament at the appropriate time when the Estimates come in. I give now to  Senator Marriott,  who raised this question, an undertaking that if he does have any difficulty in dissecting the numbers engaged in various fields in the office of the High Commissioner in London before the Estimates come under consideration, I shall be glad  to  extend to him all of the assistance in my power  to  see that  he  gets the figures that he may want. 
 
We  ranged from that through questions  of  vitriol, questions of. poetry, and discus sion of the Commonwealth of Nations as opposed to the Commonwealth of Australia. There are one or two matters on which I should like to comment. I think that all of us who listened to  Senator Cormack  can understand, although we cannot share, his irritation that it was not for him but for the High Commissioner that all the trumpets sounded on the other side. That seems to be insufficient reason for a rather generalised, sweeping attack on all members of the staff of Australia House and on the High Commissioner in particular. If sweeping attacks of this sort are made, some specific reason should be given and 1 think that the attacks are detracted from if, before they are made, we are told that the man who makes them never goes to Australia House but goes only to the Agent-General of his own State.

Obviously he included non-indigenous people, thinking that `they might be able to see us better than before' if they understood our stories. The book is particularly important because of the fact that it is perhaps the first time that an indigenous oral history has been presented in this formâas a narrative as it was expressed by the voice of the author without substantive editing and alterations. Reading some of the stories, you have a real sense of the poetry of the language and the lyricism that makes the spoken word so much more powerful than the printed. As one writer commented:"

âI am proud, humbled and a tad overwhelmed to be rising to make my first speech in this chamber. I have sat in this chamber off and on for seven years as an adviser in the back stalls, advising Democrat senators. I have to say that the chamber looks an awful lot different sitting here in its bowels.
 
It being my first speech as a law-maker, I wish to acknowledge that we meet on the traditional land of the Ngunnawal people. They, like the Mununjali and Jagera people, the traditional owners of my family's land in the Kerry Valley outside Beaudesert, lost their land in an undeclared but relentless war of conquest by our forebears. That war was wiped from our history books by the legal fiction that was terra nullius. The consequences of that dispossession stayed in the political too hard basket for generations until the Mabo High Court decision in 1992 overturned the fiction of terra nullius.
 
As law-makers, we are yet to come to terms with the full consequences of this. If Australian sovereignty was based not on the occupation of a vacant land but on the conquest of its first peoples, then, like most wars, a settlement of the terms of peace and a statement of the respective rights of victors and vanquished should be expected. Like the conquered first peoples of Canada, the United States and New Zealand, the first peoples of Australia are entitled to a treaty. A treaty would set the firm legal basis on which real and lasting reconciliation could be built.

In his first speech in this placeâwhich has been described by many people as a particularly personal one, whether in newspaper reports or by people who heard itâhe talked about his experiences in the sixties, about his love of music, of poetry, of education, of teaching and he reflected on the fact that in the sixties he had no interest in being a politician, no interest in politics per se, as that was something politicians did. From that speech he continued to break the mould, whether it was by failing to turn up in a tie to parliamentary question timeâhe did not even wear a tie for his valedictory, such was his relaxed approach to chamber dressingâ or his non-conventional approach to filing in the office, and Democrats and family will know exactly what that means."

He loved poetry. In his first speech he talked about the ability of poetry to influence our emotions. Senator Hill has referred to the Friends' School in Hobart. Robert had said that he felt that he actually learnt more from the Friends' School than he was indeed able to impart to those students. I doubt that. He said that the Friends' philosophy inspires `a gentle, caring, humble and humanitarian concern for all people as equals'. If ever a man encompassed those qualities, it was Robert John Bell."

He also shared with meâand I will put it in my termsâan interest in and a liking for the poetry of that great Tasmanian poet, James McAuley. I will not quote from the poem that is in the top of my mind, but he had a great understanding and appreciation for James McAuley's poetry. He was a laconic man; we got into several tight spots and it was his easygoing attitude that settled them down. I join with my colleagues in honouring Robert Bell for the person that he was, for what he meant to us and for his service to Tasmania and the nation. I join with all of my colleagues and the whole of the Senate in offering my condolences to the family."

I acknowledge the presence of former child migrants in the gallery. They represent all those who bravely opened their painful personal lives for the greater good of all the former child migrants. Their sacrifice of their privacy and their sharing of their pain was so that we should know and understand that it must not be in vain. The recommendations of this report of the Community Affairs References Committee, titled  Lost innocents: righting the record , must be adopted and carried out. The former child migrants deserve no less.
 
This report, as the title says, is a record as much as a report. In some ways it is itself a memorial. It is part of the great Australian story and it is a historical as well as an oral record. It is a report that chronicles evil, catalogues pain and suffering, and charts ruined lives. It is also a report that touches on the mystery and beauty of the human spirit. In its writing and its evidence it bears witness to those who have triumphed over adversity or to those who have found their own healing. We hear how other child migrants have been helped through the humanity, love, compassion and concern of their fellow human beings.
 
The experience has now thrown up people in all walks of life. It has thrown up poets and writers and men and women who have dedicated their own lives to caring for others. It has thrown up the permanently damaged and the ones in between. Suicide and early death have taken their toll. For the child migrant witnesses, the hearings were part of a long journey to be believed and understood. For the academics, historians and organisations, the hearings will give greater understanding. The inquiry has opened and closed a dark chapter in Australian history. For the committee, it represented a journey of great personal discovery. We have been asked at times to look into the face of evil. We have heard stories that made us weepâthe secretariat, committee members and Hansard staff alike.  For me, as a child migrant to Rhodesia at the age of four, it has also been a journey of self-discovery at the opening of my own private road which I am still walking. "

âI rise today to speak on a matter of public interest that is very close to all Australians. This Saturday, 11 November, is Remembrance Day. It is a time of the year when we stop to remember those men and women who fought for this country. First of all, I want to thank the women who nursed and cared for our boys who suffered injuries in the battlefield. Since the Boer War, 97 nurses have died during or as a result of war service. These wartime nurses bravely faced the same danger and conditions as the soldiers and must be commended for their bravery, patience, love and kindness. Without them, many more Australian sons would not have made it home.
 
During the First World War, Australia had the distinction of being the only Allied army that was made up of volunteers. The Aussie digger was known and respected throughout the world, both by their fellow allies and their enemies. Their cheerful bravery and apparent lack of discipline and respect for their own officers often frustrated the regimented and strict British leaders. English officers complained about the undisciplined way the Australian soldiers behaved. They were simultaneously shocked and impressed by the diggers' attitude towards the army. They addressed the officers by their first names and, when the Aussie officers were explaining extensively to their men the objectives of the battle that they were about to engage in, even the ordinary soldiers were told of the strategy so that if they became cut off they would still know what they would have to do and what goals to achieve.
 
The Australian soldiers were first thought of as undisciplined men who would not fight well and were nothing but disobedient troublemakers. In spite of this, they became one of the most feared and respected fighting machines in the world. They created fear and uncertainty in the hearts and minds of the enemy. Whether it was at the landing on the shores of Gallipoli or a march over the Owen Stanley Ranges, or whether it was in the jungles of Vietnam or the desert sands of Iraq, the diggers had a reputation for facing and overcoming impossible situations and looking out for their mates with fierce loyalty and with a wink and a cheeky grin. 
 
When a digger was captured and put in a prisoner of war camp, he was not alone. The spirit of his fellow soldiers was there with him. Here is an excerpt from a poem written by a World War II veteran, George Kelly, that describes the general feeling of the Aussie soldiers towards their captured mates. It reads:"

And the time won't be so long,
 
Chins up and stick it out
 
And we'll see you later on.
 
Remembrance Day is commemorated by a red poppy. The red Flanders poppy is a symbol of the war and its fallen heroes. Diggers, families and others remember the sacrifice of war by wearing this symbolic flower on their jackets on both Remembrance Day and Anzac Day. The poppy flower, each year, with the coming of the warm weather, sprung up in bomb craters and around trenches and often marked soldiers' graves. It brought life, hope and colour and reassured those who were still fighting. This feat of nature inspired Lieutenant John McCrae to write the now famous poem  In Flanders Fields . Then in 1918 the French YMCA Secretary, Madam Guerin, conceived the idea of selling silk poppies to help needy soldiers. The practice of wearing a red poppy for Remembrance Day began in Australia in 1921 and was first promoted by the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia as a reminder of the war dead and to raise funds for its charity work. To wear a poppy is also a sign that we have not forgotten the Australian service men and women who have died in war. On Saturday, 11 November, I urge all Australians to wear a poppy proudly and, at 11 a.m., stop for a minute's silence to remember those who have fought to keep our country free."

From 1919 to 1939, November 11 was recognised as Armistice Day. Following the end of World War 2, the name of the day was changed to Remembrance Day in order to commemorate all who have died in conflict. Today Armistice Day is commemorated by a minute's silence. 
 
The introduction of this silent tribute occurred in 1919. An Australian journalist working in London proposed a five minute silence, however it was decided by King George V (fifth) to have an official silence of two minutes. The length of this silent tribute was again shortened in 1997 by the Governor-General, Sir William Deane who proclaimed that Australians observe one minutes silence. 
 
Remembrance Day is also commemorated by the Red Poppy. The Red Flanders poppy is a symbol of the war and its fallen heroes. Diggers, their families and others remember the sacrifices of war by wearing this symbolic flower on their jackets on both Remembrance and Anzac Day. 
 
The legend of the red poppy began on the front line north of Ypres, Belgium in 1915. The areas of Northern France known as Flanders and Picardy, saw some of the most concentrated and bloodiest fighting of the First World War. There was complete devastation. Buildings, roads, trees and natural life simply disappeared. Where once there were homes and farms there was now a sea of mud - a grave for the dead where men still lived and fought. Only one other living thing survived. The poppy, flowering each year with the coming of the warm weather, sprang up in bomb craters, around trenches and often marked soldiers' graves bringing life, hope, colour and reassurance to those still fighting. This feat of nature inspired Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae to write the now famous poem, ""In Flanders Fields"". "

âAs it is close to Christmas, I want to ask a question of the Minister for the Environment and Heritage about stars. Is he aware that the space station  Endeavour  will be brighter than the brightest star in the sky, Sirius, when it is in full play, after sunset and before sunrise? I ask the minister: are we the last generation ever to see a natural night sky? Who has consulted the people, not least the poets and the lovers, about this loss of the starry commons? Does not the government regret that we will be the last generation ever to see the natural starry climes at night?

277,6/3/00,39,1,5,SENATE,12183,0,6/3/00,Senator VANSTONE,7.00E+04,Dame Roma Mitchell,Adjournment,South Australia,LP,Minister for Justice and Customs,1,0,"
 
âThis afternoon I gave notice of a motion on behalf of myself and Senators Crowley and Lees to recognise the life of Dame Roma Mitchell. The motion is formal and appropriately highlights the achievements of Dame Roma. But I think it is worth reflecting for just a few moments on what they really mean. Of course, they were all important milestones for women but they are even more important for what they actually tell us about the person, Dame Roma, herself. They tell us about her intellectual skilland that is nothing new; we all knew thatabout her determination, about her commitment and about her hard work.
 
Dame Roma commented recently that she had led a charmed life, almost as though these achievements and milestones simply fell her way. That kind of humility hides very clearly all the determination that is needed, all the commitment and the skill and the hard work that went into making it a charmed life. The plain facts are that she earned each of those achievements and milestones. Such humility and good gracewhich, if I may be slightly disparaging of our own profession, is not particularly common in either of these housesis a part of what made Dame Roma so specialabsolutely so.
 
The American poet Edna St Vincent Millay would hopefully not mind a slight alteration of one of her poems as a description of Dame Roma, the hard worker, the achiever and the charmerâan absolute charmer, Madam President, as I know you know well. The poem, slightly altered, goes something like this: "

The perception of what defiles honour has become very loose. Male control extends not just to a woman's body and her sexual behaviour but to all of her behaviour, including her movements and her language. In any of these areas, defiance by women translates into undermining male honour. Severe punishments are reported for bringing food late, for answering back or for undertaking forbidden family visits. A man's honour, defiled by a woman's alleged or real sexual misdemeanour or other defiance, is only partly restored by murdering her. He also has to kill the man allegedly involved. Since a woman is murdered first, the man often hears about it and flees. The frequency of killings and the unexpectedness with which women are targeted not surprisingly contributes to an atmosphere of fear among young women. The poet Attiya Dawood quoted a pubescent girl in a small Sindhi village:
 
My brother's eyes forever follow me. My father's gaze guards me all the time, stern, angry ... We stand accused and condemned to be declared kari and murdered.
 
Women can be killed for many reasons: it may be for expressing a desire to choose a spouse or it may be for marrying a partner of one's choice. Frequently, fathers bring charges of zina, or unlawful sexual relations, against daughters who have married men of their choice, alleging that they are not validly married. But, even when such complaints are before the courts, some men still resort to private justice. Often women choosing a spouse are abducted and are never heard of again. Women who have sought divorce through the courts have been attacked, injured or killed. Seeking divorce is seen as an act of public defiance which calls for punitive action to restore male honour. Even more horrific is that they may be killed if they are raped. The victims of a violent crime are seen to be the perpetrators and the ones who have to be murdered. Amnesty outlines some horrific stories. I will not go into them. They are just too horrible to go into.
 
Amazingly, there are even fake honour killings. Where the woman is killed and the man escapes, as is often the case, the man has to compensate the affected manâthe husband or the other male relativeâfor the damage to honour he inflicted, for the worth of the woman who was killed and to have his own life spared. This scheme provides many opportunities to make money, to obtain a woman in compensation or to conceal other crimes, in the near certainty that honour killingsâif they come to courtâwill be dealt with leniently. There is an honour killing industry involving tribespeople, police and tribal mediators. Time does not permit me to go into any more detail on this practice, but the concern that I share with Amnesty is the Pakistan state's abrogation of their responsibilities. I urge everybody to have a look at the Amnesty web site and I urge the government to make much more public their abhorrence of this dreadful practice. "

This year, on 18 May, a group of veterans and relatives were flown from Kununurra on board an RAAF Caribou to Truscott airfield and were joined late on the Friday afternoon by me, Senator Lightfoot and Barry Haase, the federal member for Kalgoorlie. As the tropical sun set in the western sky a dedication service was held, and a plaque dedicated to the fitters and motor drivers transport crews was fixed to an obelisk which is outside the main building on the base. The plaque complements those already on the obelisk which are dedicated to various categories of servicemen who served at the base during the Second World War. On the next morning, all present gathered before dawn at the wreckage of a Liberator which had crashed fully laden on take-off, killing all on board. Poignantly, the now middle-aged niece of one of the crew, Flight Sergeant Easton, read a memorial poem as the dawn light broke through the gum trees and the bugler of the Norforce detachment played the last post and reveille at the end of two minutes silence.
 
Indeed, the reunion afforded an opportunity for those present to commemorate the sacrifices of the service men and women throughout the war, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice by laying down their lives in the service of our country. Significantly, Truscott was the location of the final Japanese aeroplane to be shot down over Australian soil. On 20 July 1944, a Japanese Dinah left Timor on a reconaissance mission to photograph significant sites in the Kimberley. The aircraft was detected by the radar station at Truscott, and at 8.45 in the morning the three Spitfire pilots on duty at Truscott were alerted and placed on standby to scramble. A few minutes later the pilots were ordered to take off and, shortly afterwards, the Dinah was shot down.
 
The reunion at Truscott, although it was very simple and not attended by a great number of people, provided a unique opportunity to meet the Truscott veterans and gain an impression of what it must have been like to serve at this isolated, tropical base in the dark days of the Pacific war when our homeland was under threat of invasion. The weekend is one I will long remember. I would especially like to thank Howard Young of Kununurra, who was involved in organising this event and was responsible for inviting me to join the reunion weekend. The Truscott experience led me to reflect on the importance of our freedom and democratic traditions and of how close we came to losing them within liv-ing memory. It is said that the price of maintain-ing freedom and democracy is eternal vigilance. Surely the lesson of Truscott is that we, the Australians of today, have an obligation to those who fought so valiantly, particularly those who made the ultimate sacrifice, to preserve our freedom and to maintain equal vigilance in the world of today to protect our democratic traditions. It is naive to believe that there are no threats to them in this modern world. "

âThe Minister for Health and Aged Care has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: 
 
	(1)	(a) Essentially, all medicines, unless they are specifically exempt or excluded, must be either listed or registered in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods, before they can be supplied in Australia.  Although the US Food and Drug Administration approved Neumega in November 1997, it is not currently approved for use in Australia. Registration for marketing is granted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) .  While a key focus of the TGA is to ensure that consumers have timely access to medicines, registration is conferred only following detailed evaluation of scientific and medical data on the use of a drug.  The terms of registration specify those conditions in which the drug has been demonstrated to be acceptably safe and effective. 
 
	Under certain circumstances, medical practitioners may use the Special Access Scheme to prescribe drugs not yet approved for the Australian market.  Such prescribing enables treatment of serious medical conditions in patients who have provided their informed consent.  Approval to obtain such drugs is arranged through the Drug Safety Evaluation Branch of the TGA.
 
	(b) Through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) , the Government subsidises the cost of drugs and medicinal products to the Australian community, providing reliable and affordable access to a wide range of necessary medicines.  Before a medicine can be subsidised via the PBS, it must be assessed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC)  - an independent expert body of doctors and other health scientists.  The PBAC is required to take into account a number of criteria, including the uses for which a medicine has been approved for marketing in Australia.   
 
	Erythropoietin (now known as epoetin) preparations are registered for marketing for the treatment of patients with symptomatic or transfusion-requiring anaemia associated with chronic renal failure.  They are available on the PBS for this condition as a highly specialised drug available through hospital pharmacies for outpatients. 
 
	Epoetin is also registered for the prevention and treatment of anaemia in adult patients with non-myeloid malignancies.  However, it is not registered for marketing for any other conditions, including myelodysplasia, which result in anaemia.  Medications cannot be considered for listing on the PBS for the treatment of conditions for which they are not registered. 
 
	(2) As indicated above, until the sponsor of Epoetin seeks registration for the treatment of anaemia resulting from myelodysplasia, it cannot be considered for PBS subsidy. Similarly, until the sponsor of Neumega seeks and receives appropriate marketing approval for this product and applies for a PBS listing to include the treatment of anaemia resulting from myelodysplasia, the PBAC is not in a position to be able to consider it for subsidisation under the PBS."

âMadam Deputy President, I hope those organisations hear the groans from the other side. That poem encapsulates what the feelings of those people are. They do not want politics in this. They do not want it used as a political footballâthey really do not. I would like to get that through to the Labor Party: take the politics out of it. Listen to what those good people in the gallery are trying to tell you. Listen to what they are saying instead of playing political football with an issue which is far too important for Senator Faulkner to point score on."

âOn 27 June this year I spoke in the adjournment debate on the passing of one of our greatest poets of the 20th centuryâJudith Wright. Since the parliament went into recess, we have seen the passing of two other great figures of Australian literature of the 20th century. I refer to Alec Hope and Dr Clement Semmler. I just wish to make a few remarks tonight about their contribution to our literary heritage and culture.
 
Alec Hope, or A.D. Hope as he was more commonly known, died on 13 July at the age of 92. If Judith Wright was the grand old lady of Australian poetryâand I do not say that with any disrespectâthen certainly A.D. Hope was the grand old man of Australian poetry. Indeed, he was regarded by many critics, academics and fellow writers both here and internationally as probably Australia's greatest ever poet. That is a hard call to make but it is one that I know is shared by many. His poetry was an interesting mix of classic verse, drawing on the huge knowledge he had of Greek and Roman mythology, biblical allusions and Medieval and Old English. He was a genuine intellectual in the sense that he was forever trying to increase his knowledge. I understand he studied quite a number of different languages. One of the obituaries I read said that, having learned a number of languages, including German, Arabic and Russian, he finally gave up on Japanese. But his contribution to Australian poetry and to Australian literary culture and heritage was enormous.
 
He was a classical writer but, at the same time, he is also renowned for his cutting satire, his whimsy and, indeed, the sensuality of much of his poetry. In those days it was regarded as highly erotic but today it would probably be regarded as fairly mild. He was a visionary in many ways and had a profound commitment to the importance of universities as institutions which challenge ideas and promote intellectual rigour. In that capacity he set out to put Australian literature firmly on the map in Australian university studies. He was responsible for the establishment of the first full-time course in Australian literature at the Canberra University College, which later became the Australian National University. That led to him living in Canberra and holding the chair of literature at the ANU for some 17-odd years, until he retired in 1967. I understand that he continued to regularly play an active role in the Australian National University and that he continued to write and study there throughout his remaining years.
 
So he was both a poet and a teacher and, as I said, his contribution to Australian literature was immense. I always had the feeling when I read Hope's work that I was reading not just an Australian poet or work from an Australian literary figure but someone who stood among the great figures of literature of the 20th century in the international sphere. That is important because, while one should not regard our literary heritage as being in any way second-rate, certainly for a long time in Australian universities the study of literature was simply the study of English and American literature. It was Coleridge, Yeats, Tennyson, Blake and so on that you studied. There was really no move towards Australian literature until people like Alec Hope and, subsequently, one of his students, Leonie Kramer, really pushed for its development as a course of study in itself. Alec Hope actually put Australian literature on the international scene, and that is something I am sure is appreciated today by many of our current writers and poets. 
 
The other person I referred to who has passed away, and whose achievements and contributions I think should also be acknowledged by this parliament, was Dr Clement Semmler. I have to say that I do not think I had much in common with Dr Semmler's views on a range of issues. He was an acknowledged conservative in his views. He was not a poet or a novelist. He was what those professions probably dread: he was a literary critic. Any student of literature knows that you have to read the critics as well as the writers themselves. Sometimes critics take on a status almost equal to the writers. One can think of great critics in literary history, such as Samuel Johnson or F. R. Leavis, who had as much fame as those they wrote about. Clement Semmler was foremost among Australian literary critics and certainly it was a requirement for any student at university, as I recall, to read his work. He was also a book reviewer for the  Sydney Morning Herald  for well over 20 years and in that capacity made a great contribution to promoting the development of Australian novelists.
 
But Clement Semmler had one other important contribution, and that was his role with the ABC. As I understand it, from reading up on some of the obituary notices, he worked for the ABC for over 30 years and he was very much associated with the development of Radio Australia. He held a senior position as deputy general manager within the ABC and in Radio Australia for, as I said, well over 30 years. He was a promoter of quality within the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He eschewed the chase for ratings and, indeed, I understand that programs such as  Four Corners  came about very much because of his determination to promote quality Australian programming on the ABC. I am sure that he would have been appalled at some of the things that this government has endeavoured to do to the ABC, for which he worked and contributed so much to throughout his life. As I said, I did not necessarily agree with his viewsâI do not think many on our side would have agreed with many of the views he held. They were conservative; nevertheless, he made an outstanding contribution both to Australian literature and to the ABC, in particular, and I think it is appropriate that that be recorded in the Senate."

He was responsible for the establishment of the first full-time course in Australian literature at the Canberra University College, which later became the Australian National University. That led to him living in Canberra and holding the chair of literature at the ANU for some 17-odd years, until he retired in 1967. I understand that he continued to regularly play an active role in the Australian National University and that he continued to write and study there throughout his remaining years.
 
So he was both a poet and a teacher and, as I said, his contribution to Australian literature was immense. I always had the feeling when I read Hope's work that I was reading not just an Australian poet or work from an Australian literary figure but someone who stood among the great figures of literature of the 20th century in the international sphere. That is important because, while one should not regard our literary heritage as being in any way second-rate, certainly for a long time in Australian universities the study of literature was simply the study of English and American literature. It was Coleridge, Yeats, Tennyson, Blake and so on that you studied. There was really no move towards Australian literature until people like Alec Hope and, subsequently, one of his students, Leonie Kramer, really pushed for its development as a course of study in itself. Alec Hope actually put Australian literature on the international scene, and that is something I am sure is appreciated today by many of our current writers and poets. 
 
The other person I referred to who has passed away, and whose achievements and contributions I think should also be acknowledged by this parliament, was Dr Clement Semmler. I have to say that I do not think I had much in common with Dr Semmler's views on a range of issues. He was an acknowledged conservative in his views. He was not a poet or a novelist. He was what those professions probably dread: he was a literary critic. Any student of literature knows that you have to read the critics as well as the writers themselves. Sometimes critics take on a status almost equal to the writers. One can think of great critics in literary history, such as Samuel Johnson or F. R. Leavis, who had as much fame as those they wrote about. Clement Semmler was foremost among Australian literary critics and certainly it was a requirement for any student at university, as I recall, to read his work. He was also a book reviewer for the  Sydney Morning Herald  for well over 20 years and in that capacity made a great contribution to promoting the development of Australian novelists.
 
But Clement Semmler had one other important contribution, and that was his role with the ABC. As I understand it, from reading up on some of the obituary notices, he worked for the ABC for over 30 years and he was very much associated with the development of Radio Australia. He held a senior position as deputy general manager within the ABC and in Radio Australia for, as I said, well over 30 years. He was a promoter of quality within the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He eschewed the chase for ratings and, indeed, I understand that programs such as  Four Corners  came about very much because of his determination to promote quality Australian programming on the ABC. I am sure that he would have been appalled at some of the things that this government has endeavoured to do to the ABC, for which he worked and contributed so much to throughout his life. As I said, I did not necessarily agree with his viewsâI do not think many on our side would have agreed with many of the views he held. They were conservative; nevertheless, he made an outstanding contribution both to Australian literature and to the ABC, in particular, and I think it is appropriate that that be recorded in the Senate.
 
He was a classical writer but, at the same time, he is also renowned for his cutting satire, his whimsy and, indeed, the sensuality of much of his poetry. In those days it was regarded as highly erotic but today it would probably be regarded as fairly mild. He was a visionary in many ways and had a profound commitment to the importance of universities as institutions which challenge ideas and promote intellectual rigour. In that capacity he set out to put Australian literature firmly on the map in Australian university studies.

âOn 27 June this year I spoke in the adjournment debate on the passing of one of our greatest poets of the 20th centuryâJudith Wright.

I just wish to make a few remarks tonight about their contribution to our literary heritage and culture.
 
Alec Hope, or A.D. Hope as he was more commonly known, died on 13 July at the age of 92. If Judith Wright was the grand old lady of Australian poetryâand I do not say that with any disrespectâthen certainly A.D. Hope was the grand old man of Australian poetry. Indeed, he was regarded by many critics, academics and fellow writers both here and internationally as probably Australia's greatest ever poet. That is a hard call to make but it is one that I know is shared by many. His poetry was an interesting mix of classic verse, drawing on the huge knowledge he had of Greek and Roman mythology, biblical allusions and Medieval and Old English. He was a genuine intellectual in the sense that he was forever trying to increase his knowledge. I understand he studied quite a number of different languages. One of the obituaries I read said that, having learned a number of languages, including German, Arabic and Russian, he finally gave up on Japanese. But his contribution to Australian poetry and to Australian literary culture and heritage was enormous.
 
He was a classical writer but, at the same time, he is also renowned for his cutting satire, his whimsy and, indeed, the sensuality of much of his poetry. In those days it was regarded as highly erotic but today it would probably be regarded as fairly mild.

One of the obituaries I read said that, having learned a number of languages, including German, Arabic and Russian, he finally gave up on Japanese. But his contribution to Australian poetry and to Australian literary culture and heritage was enormous.
 
He was a classical writer but, at the same time, he is also renowned for his cutting satire, his whimsy and, indeed, the sensuality of much of his poetry. In those days it was regarded as highly erotic but today it would probably be regarded as fairly mild. He was a visionary in many ways and had a profound commitment to the importance of universities as institutions which challenge ideas and promote intellectual rigour. In that capacity he set out to put Australian literature firmly on the map in Australian university studies. He was responsible for the establishment of the first full-time course in Australian literature at the Canberra University College, which later became the Australian National University. That led to him living in Canberra and holding the chair of literature at the ANU for some 17-odd years, until he retired in 1967. I understand that he continued to regularly play an active role in the Australian National University and that he continued to write and study there throughout his remaining years.
 
So he was both a poet and a teacher and, as I said, his contribution to Australian literature was immense. I always had the feeling when I read Hope's work that I was reading not just an Australian poet or work from an Australian literary figure but someone who stood among the great figures of literature of the 20th century in the international sphere. That is important because, while one should not regard our literary heritage as being in any way second-rate, certainly for a long time in Australian universities the study of literature was simply the study of English and American literature. It was Coleridge, Yeats, Tennyson, Blake and so on that you studied. There was really no move towards Australian literature until people like Alec Hope and, subsequently, one of his students, Leonie Kramer, really pushed for its development as a course of study in itself. Alec Hope actually put Australian literature on the international scene, and that is something I am sure is appreciated today by many of our current writers and poets. 
 
The other person I referred to who has passed away, and whose achievements and contributions I think should also be acknowledged by this parliament, was Dr Clement Semmler. I have to say that I do not think I had much in common with Dr Semmler's views on a range of issues. He was an acknowledged conservative in his views. He was not a poet or a novelist. He was what those professions probably dread: he was a literary critic. Any student of literature knows that you have to read the critics as well as the writers themselves. Sometimes critics take on a status almost equal to the writers. One can think of great critics in literary history, such as Samuel Johnson or F. R. Leavis, who had as much fame as those they wrote about. Clement Semmler was foremost among Australian literary critics and certainly it was a requirement for any student at university, as I recall, to read his work. He was also a book reviewer for the  Sydney Morning Herald  for well over 20 years and in that capacity made a great contribution to promoting the development of Australian novelists.
 
But Clement Semmler had one other important contribution, and that was his role with the ABC. As I understand it, from reading up on some of the obituary notices, he worked for the ABC for over 30 years and he was very much associated with the development of Radio Australia. He held a senior position as deputy general manager within the ABC and in Radio Australia for, as I said, well over 30 years. He was a promoter of quality within the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He eschewed the chase for ratings and, indeed, I understand that programs such as  Four Corners  came about very much because of his determination to promote quality Australian programming on the ABC. I am sure that he would have been appalled at some of the things that this government has endeavoured to do to the ABC, for which he worked and contributed so much to throughout his life. As I said, I did not necessarily agree with his viewsâI do not think many on our side would have agreed with many of the views he held. They were conservative; nevertheless, he made an outstanding contribution both to Australian literature and to the ABC, in particular, and I think it is appropriate that that be recorded in the Senate.

âOn 27 June this year I spoke in the adjournment debate on the passing of one of our greatest poets of the 20th centuryâJudith Wright. Since the parliament went into recess, we have seen the passing of two other great figures of Australian literature of the 20th century. I refer to Alec Hope and Dr Clement Semmler. I just wish to make a few remarks tonight about their contribution to our literary heritage and culture.

Alec Hope, or A.D. Hope as he was more commonly known, died on 13 July at the age of 92. If Judith Wright was the grand old lady of Australian poetryâand I do not say that with any disrespectâthen certainly A.D. Hope was the grand old man of Australian poetry. Indeed, he was regarded by many critics, academics and fellow writers both here and internationally as probably Australia's greatest ever poet. That is a hard call to make but it is one that I know is shared by many. His poetry was an interesting mix of classic verse, drawing on the huge knowledge he had of Greek and Roman mythology, biblical allusions and Medieval and Old English. He was a genuine intellectual in the sense that he was forever trying to increase his knowledge. I understand he studied quite a number of different languages.

âLast weekend saw the passing of one of the giants of Australian literature of the 20th century. I refer to the passing of Judith Wright. I am sure there is not a person in this parliament and probably not a person in this country over the age of about 30, maybe even younger, who at some stage in their life did not read some of Judith Wright's poetry. It was on the syllabus of high school literature for as long as I can remember, and I am sure many of us recall learning off by heart the words to poems such as  Bullocky  or "

âNo, time does not permit and my memory is not that good, but I do remember those wonderful references to `sinewy hands'. I had the pleasure of meeting Judith Wright on a couple of occasions during the early 1970s when I was studying literature at Sydney University. There was a course in Australian literature in either 1971 or 1972âI cannot recall exactly which year. We were fortunate to have as guest lecturers and guest tutors people such as James McAuley, Alec Hope, David Maloufânow a world renowned Australian authorâand Judith Wright. I can still recall watching Judith Wright stand before a lecture theatre at Sydney University, talking to us for about an hour about her ideas on poetry. She certainly left an incredible legacy in terms of not only the volume of her work over some 60-odd years or more of writing poetry but also her commitment to many other issues.  "

Her poetry, as has been reflected upon in articles written in newspapers and journals in recent days, celebrated the land, the harshness and the beauty of the Australian landscape. It celebrated the environment and pointed to how man has been the destroyer of the environment as well as reaping the benefits of it. Her poetry reflected on our historyâthe great aspects and the injustices, particularly those perpetrated upon the indigenous people. She was a conservative poet but she was never a conservative person in outlook. By `conservative' I mean in the literary sense of someone who paid particular attention to form and substance. She was to poetry what Patrick White was to the Australian novel and Sidney Nolan and Drysdale were to Australian painting. They were people who were able to reflect, as Judith Wright did in words, on all that makes Australia great as a nation but equally those aspects that we have to focus upon and try to correct. "

We were fortunate to have as guest lecturers and guest tutors people such as James McAuley, Alec Hope, David Maloufânow a world renowned Australian authorâand Judith Wright. I can still recall watching Judith Wright stand before a lecture theatre at Sydney University, talking to us for about an hour about her ideas on poetry. She certainly left an incredible legacy in terms of not only the volume of her work over some 60-odd years or more of writing poetry but also her commitment to many other issues.

Her poetry, as has been reflected upon in articles written in newspapers and journals in recent days, celebrated the land, the harshness and the beauty of the Australian landscape. It celebrated the environment and pointed to how man has been the destroyer of the environment as well as reaping the benefits of it. Her poetry reflected on our historyâthe great aspects and the injustices, particularly those perpetrated upon the indigenous people. She was a conservative poet but she was never a conservative person in outlook. By `conservative' I mean in the literary sense of someone who paid particular attention to form and substance. She was to poetry what Patrick White was to the Australian novel and Sidney Nolan and Drysdale were to Australian painting. They were people who were able to reflect, as Judith Wright did in words, on all that makes Australia great as a nation but equally those aspects that we have to focus upon and try to correct. 
 
Whilst being, as I said, a conservative poet in terms of her style, she was at a very early ageâindeed, in the 1940sâwriting about personal relationships and touching upon subjects that did not become major political issues until the feminist revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, many a critic has been astounded by the ideas and the issues that she raised in her work  Woman to Man , published in 1949. Judith Wright, as people have clearly recognised in commenting upon her life, was a strong advocate for the environment, a lifelong member of the Australian Conservation Foundation and particularly a supporter for the cause of indigenous people. She was a supporter for that cause long before many of us saw the light and recognised that we had to do something about correcting the injustices of the past. I note, as her biographer, Sister Veronica Brady, noted in an article in the paper today, that one of the Judith Wright's last public acts was to lead the Reconciliation Walk across the bridge in Canberra a couple of weeks ago.

I look back, like everyone I suppose, with fond memories of reading her poetry as a student at school and being forced to learn it off by heart, coming later to recognise what a wonderful contribution she has made to our literary history. As I said, she is the last of the giants of Australian literature of the 20th century. People like James McAuley and Alec Hope and others have gone before her, and Judith Wright represents the end of an era of great poetry and literature that we had in Australia in the middle and latter part of the last century. No doubt other younger and talented writers, authors and poets will continue that tradition. I think her contribution not only to Australian literature but also to the nation is probably best reflected in the captions of two articles in today's  Australian.  One article written by Julian Croft is headed `Poet probed the nation's soul'. The other  article by Veronica Brady is headed `Guardian of the land and people'. 
 
I make these comments tonight in the adjournment debate, which, I believe, is the appropriate place to do it. But I wish to make this point: I think it is a shame that there is a procedural impediment in this chamber so that we are not able to move notices of motion to honour the memory of people such as Judith Wright and their contribution. I know that in the past when people, including me, have moved notices of motion to pay tribute to somebody who has made an outstanding achievement in Australian life it has been said that, unless you can link that person's contribution to something that this parliament or this chamber deals with, you cannot move it. Maybe I am wrong with regard to this situation, but I recall, for instance, when we have tried on similar occasions to reflect the achievements of sporting heroes or other heroes it has not been allowed. That is the advice I have received from the President. If it were possible to do it, I would have preferred to do it by notice of motion. I am getting nods from the chair. All I can say, Madam Acting Deputy President Knowles, is that I do not think the guidelines are that clear. If we are going to say that we can do it for some who have made a great contribution to Australian life but not for others, then I think we should sort that issue out. 
 
In any event, I have appreciated the opportunity here tonight to place some comments on the record in the adjournment debate about the great contribution Judith Wright made to our culture, to our historyand, above all, to the Australian people and the Australian nation. 
 
 Senate adjourned at 10.45 p.m. 
 
The following answers to questions were circulated:"
297,7/3/00,39,1,5,SENATE,12277,0,7/3/00,Senator CRANE,UW4,Aboriginal Reconcilliation,Matters of Urgency,Western Australia,LP,Leader of the Opposition in the Senate,1,0,"
 
âI too rise to speak on this motion before us today. I think the important thing about this motion is that, if we truly believe in reconciliation, it can only happen and will only succeed if it comes from the hearts and the minds of every Australian. I put that on the record right up-front. It is very different to the position we have just heard from Senator Faulkner. I do not have a problem in expressing that particular view. I have certainly seen many times in many parts of my home state of Western Australia that reconciliation is a long way down the track. In other parts of the state, it is a much more difficult and slower process. I think that, in dealing with the issue in this parliament, if we do not recognise as members of parliament that particular aspect, we are going to be the ones who stand in the way of the process of reconciliation. I think that would be very sad.
 
As I have said in this place on a number of previous occasions, I regard myself as a lucky Australian because I grew up in the Bindi Bindi-Moora area, where 25 per cent of the population were Aboriginal people. For every year but one of my primary school days I went to a school where there were more Aboriginals than there were Europeans or others. So I got a very lucky education in learning to live among Aboriginals. Even today, many of those people whom I went to school with are still some of my very best and closest friends. I say quite categorically that, in dealing with this particular issue, we cannot try to force something down from the top. I accept we can give leadership; I accept we can say it is necessary. But what we have to instil in the minds of Australians, including indigenous Australians and the Europeans and others who came to this country in the last couple of hundred years, is that they have got to want to do it. They have to go out and actively do it in their own constituencies and lives.
 
I repeat what I said before: unless that happens, reconciliation will not happen. Putting dates, deadlines or particular tasks in front of us actually impedes the process, because people either push too hard and get people off side or they take it a little too slowly when they could have done something to assist and communicate. Many of us did act, and many of our friendships and understandings were built in strange places, such as a shearing shed, or in different positions across the sports field, playing football or cricket.
 
At this stage, I would like to recognise in the chamber Senator Ridgeway, who was one of the architectsâif not the architect, then author or poetâof the statement that was made here when this parliament expressed deep and sincere regret for the injustices suffered by indigenous Australians. In my view, that says a lot more about recognising the issues and what occurred than just saying sorry. I think it was a profound and important statement. It will do a lot to assist Australians in coming to grips with the issue of reconciliation and what it means.  "

.- As  Senator E.  D. Millen has specifically and very kindly referred to  myself, I, as the officer subordinate to you, sir, in this Chamber, wish to add a few words to those which have fallen so happily from your lips. I have had a good deal of experience of the officers and attendants, and I must say that I indorse everything that has been said regarding them. It was my good fortune, when I first entered this Chamber, to make the acquaintance of the then  Clerk  of the Senate and his assistant. I refer to 
 
  At the suggestion of legal members of thisChamber, I wish to say a word or two of the work of the Parliamentary Draftsmen. I am informed by honorable senators who are qualified to sit in judgment upon the labours of these officers that they regard their work very highly, notwithstanding occasional criticisms directed against it. These criticisms are well withinthe province and competence of representatives of the electors of Australia, but honorable senators who are also members of the legal profession consider the work of the Parliamentary Draftsmen of the highest order of merit. I feel sure that I am properly, if unworthily, echoing the sentiments they conveyed to me. 
 
I think with yourself, sir, that there will not be very many vacancies in our ranks after the elections. I have expressed a similar hope on previous occasions, but this time I speak feelingly, because I have to put on my armour, in common with many of my brother senators, and go forth to battle in the vast forest ofblue pencils. I hope that we shall come through the conflict triumphantly, and will for years to come be in a position by the exercise of our mental faculties to assist the nation to get the best out of life. I hope that we shall see Australia flourish increasingly, that it will add to its population, and will each year become of still greater importance in the councils and ways of the world. If unfortunately some of us should fall by the wayside I hope it will be shown that the electors have sent men to this Chamber who are philosophers as well as senators. I hope we shall follow the advice of Kipling, and whether we are successful or unsuccessful, will face the issue in the spirit which the poet recommended - "

- ""O God! that men would see a little clearer."" That will be sufficient. I should also like to remind my honorable friends opposite of two other fine pieces of poetry, not quite so fashionable just now, ""The Song, of the Shirt,"" by Thomas Hood, and lines, "" The Cry of the Children,"" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Honorable members opposite profess not to understand the reasons why the Labour party opposes this Bill. I do not think that I have heard any debate in which they have expressed to such an extent as in this case their inability to understand the reason for our opposition. This is not so much an immigration as an emigration bill, for the whole debate seems to have centred round the compulsory emigration clauses. After all, it seems to me not so important that the Government should bring down these restrictive clauses as it is that the administration by Ministers themselves should be efficient. I pointed out in this chamber some time ago that great inefficiency was shown in the management of immigration affairs, and that there was a grave danger of admitting mental defectives. I showed how, during the regime of this Government, a mental defective had been admitted into the country, and in my own electorate had committed a diabolical act on a child of five years of age. I might add that one of the last acts of another Nationalist Government, which recently went out of office in New South ""Wales, was to liberate that man after he had served one year and nine months of his sentence- to liberate him again, not upon this society, but upon the society of the Old World, which should really be of equal importance to us in this ' regard. I also draw attention again to the startling facts which I recently gave concerning two notable families in the United States of America - the dreadful number of mental defectives that had descended from them, and the enormous cost they had been to the government of that country. These facts have been added to by the recent cases in New Zealand. I have no doubt that Ministers have had their attention drawn to this danger, and it should not be necessary to emphasize the desirability of keeping, mentally defective persons out of Australia. I come now to that part of the bill around which the greater part of the debate has raged - the compulsory emigration clauses. I think that I can understand the inability of honorable members opposite to appreciate the reasons for Labour's opposition to the bill. One reason for our opposition to it is that the great body of workers in Australia known as the trade unions are emphatically opposed to it. "

- That answer has always been given from the very initiation of the trade union movement. When its pioneers sought to improve the workers' conditions, the reply was, ""We are in sympathy with you, but, unfortunately, economic doctrines prevent us from assisting you."" Economic arguments, and everything in the intellectual line, even the Darwinian theory, were raked up to prevent the workers obtaining decent conditions, and to-day one hears the same old cries. If members of the Country party have not opposed us, they have not remained passive, for they - or, at any rate, the party behind which they stand - has at all times opposed the principles espoused by Labour. Instead of belittling trade unionism, instead of advertising throughout the world, that Australia has been ruined by trade unionism, they should let it be known that trade unionism has been the salvation of this country. Instead of being negligent of the international Labour conference, the Country party should recognize and make known the fact that the improved conditions of the workers have enabled them to be greater consumers than formerly of the primary products of Australia, and they should advise the people of other countries to adopt the same standard of wages and conditions as are enjoyed by workers in Australia, and thus increase the markets for primary products. But, blinded as they are to the necessity of improving the conditions of the workers, one cannot expect them to cast their bread upon the waters in the hope that it will return to them after many days. The success of this move- . ment is due to the workers themselves, to their system of intense organization, and to their determination to stand together in the face of spurious economic doctrines which were always written for a purpose. They determined that the work of man should have more recognition than some purely abstract doctrine, and they have shown for their cause and ideals a loyalty and devotion, and a readiness to sacrifice themselves, which I think has not been excelled, if equalled, by the devotees of any other cause. One of the guiding principles of unionism has always been ""our union, right or wrong."" Experience has shown unionists that only by acting on that principle can they attain their end. If our country is involved in war, we are apt to forget the real and immediate issue, and accept the dictum, "" My country, right or wrong."" In the same way, the experience of the unionist compels him to accept and follow the advice of his leaders. I do not know whether honorable members will admit that, but they should not forget that unionists know their industrial history. They know that in past times the state has done nothing for them, that during the whole of the black period of the beginning of their movement the state did nothing for them, and that all the advantages they now enjoy in the shape of better industrial conditions, higher wages, and shorter hours have been secured through the work and instrumentality of the unions. We cannot condemn the unionist if, seeing that his union is so close to him, and has won for him such benefits, he at times puts it before his state. Personally, I agree that it is rather to be regretted that there should be a conflict between loyalty to a union and loyalty to a state. That conflict hasat times occurred, and has resulted in disaster to the unions and temporary disaster to the state; but I think no unionist can be blamed for it in the circumstances. Devotion to their organizations has been the cause of suffering to unionists in times of crisis. Honorable members, if they knew their political and industrial history, would agree with me that the records of leaders of race and religion are not greater or more to be admired than the records of the leaders of the cause and ideals of unionism throughout the world. I think that, although their graves may be more obscure, and they may not be sung in poetry or music, they are equally worthy of our admiration. All that I have referred to has been done in spite of the opposition of those who have on every occasion been opposed to every movement for the betterment of the workers' conditions. Those who have represented the same political thought as honorable members on the other side have always been opposed to them, although they have eventually had to confess that the Labour movement has been one for the benefit, not of the individual, but. the whole race. One of the Prime Ministers of Great Britain - the late W. E. Gladstone - on a certain occasion, after showing opposition to measures of this kind, said something like this, ""We should reflect that in nearly all the political controversies of the last 30 years the wealthy class, the leisured class, and the titled class have been wrong. It is well to remember that it is to the common man of the ordinary working class we are indebted to-day for almost all the political reforms which are now accepted by the world."" "

- Of course, the Territory has practically cost South Australia nothing. During this debate, we have heard a good deal about the necessity for constructing the proposed transcontinental line from north to south from the Oodnadatta end. Now, I have travelled on the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, and a more Godforsaken country I never saw in my life, and hope never to see again. From the moment that we left Port Augusta until we landed at Oodnadatta, we saw nothing but drifting sand. The country was a howling desert. Formerly, I used to wonder how the epithet "" howling "" came to be applied to the desert, but, after my visit to Oodnadatta, I understood it quite well. When I heard the melancholy howl of the wind, and saw the drifting sand covering up everything, I understood the application of the term. We reached Oodnadatta in the evening, and all night long the wind blew like fury. Next morning, nearly everything was  snowed-up  with sand. Some honorable senators had to dig themselves out. Of course, the people told us, "" Oh, we have not experienced a night like this for forty years."" I believe that our experience is quite a common occurrence. In the morning, I saw an Afghan digging out his camel team, and he seemed to set about it as if it were part of the day's work. The residents of Oodnadatta said, "" Of course, the land here is not very good, but a  little  ahead you will find splendid country."" The promised land is always ahead, and, of course, these simpleminded people knew that we were not going there. They added, "" When you get to the Barklay Tableland, and the Macdonnell Ranges, the country is a perfect, paradise. There is nothing in Australia like it."" I beg leave to doubt that statement. The country there may be everything that the poetic fancy .of these people paint it; but I desire, the evidence of men who have been sent there by the Commonwealth Government, anc? who are responsible to the people of Australia for their report. I do not wantthe tales of any De Rougemont. I want, a plain, unvarnished tale concerning the Barklay Tableland and the Macdonnell Ranges. "

- The honorable senator will probably recollect that I asked for certain information in the shape of reports. I intend to peruse those reports, and thus to become fortified with knowledge on this matter, before I cast] a  vote in favour of committing the Commonwealth to an expenditure which could be more profitably incurred by the various States  in  an endeavour to promote settlement. It is highly desirable that we should at the earliest opportunity do all that we can to bring from other countries, or to rear in our own,  an  increase of population, for until Australia has a population of about 20,000,000 she cannot be regarded as reasonably safe. Let us introduce population - above all, let us rear  it  if we can, because as the French poet has said - "

- If Germany finds it necessary to increase the number of her troops France immediately responds by providing that for the conscripts there shall be a three-yearly service instead of a two-yearly one. In like manner, when Great Britain builds so many  Dreadnoughts  Germany decides that she must build so many more. Consequently, the nations in Europe are each intently watching the other, not merely to see whether a particular nation has as many troops, or as many ships, as the other, but whether it keeps up its relative strength, and whether, by any possible combination with its allies, it may be able 'to hold the position should it ever be seriously attacked. We should take a secondary position to that altogether. To say that because the annual expenditure per head of the people of Great Britain or France, or Germany, may be so much justifies us in going to the same annual expenditure per head does not seem to me to be warranted by the facts of the situation. The fact that Great Britain is within practically a stone's throw of France, Germany, and Italy, and that those countries are next-door neighbours to each other, compels them, if they mean to keep in the race at all, to keep up their relative strength, if not to try to make it better. But with us there is no occasion to go to anything like the proportionate length that they do, because of the vast distances that separate us from the fighting nations of the world. It is all very well to say that modern inventions have annihilated time and space. That is a poetic expression; it is not a literal fact. Notwithstanding all the improvements in locomotives - steam, oil fuel, and so on - -there is still a big handicap against any European nation that would attempt to invade Australia. It is idle to contend that we should expend anything like the amount per head on our protection that it may be necessary for European nations to expend on their protection. To look forward to the time when there will be peace between the nations of the earth is merely to look forward to the realization of a pious aspiration. I am not going to indulge in any speculation as to when that aspiration will be realized. There is no need for us to think tbat we are going to play a principal part in any drama which may be enacted in those countries of Europe in which a huge military and naval expenditure is being incurred. When we talk of the rapidly expanding naval armament of Germany menacing the naval superiority of Great Britain, we should remember that it is merely idle speculation to say that this or that country, by securing a majorityof ships, will necessarily be able to wipe out another country. Owing to the alliances which take place, no man can say that the mere fact of one nation being numerically stronger than another will give it the victory if a conflict should take place. When we recognise that the constant alliances and understandings between the different armed nations of the earth may at any time change the situation, we need not watch every little move on the part of those nations. We should content ourselves with providing a force that is reasonably sufficient to repel any attack that may take place on our shores. We should not attempt to rival other nations whose armaments are being built up, not merely for defensive, but for offensive, purposes. For this reason we should be satisfied with a small force, provided that it is trained up to the highest point of efficiency. We should aim at efficiency, but not at a huge and constantly growing expenditure, and neither the reports of Lord Kitchener nor of Admiral Henderson will in any way affect my feelings in that matter. We should set a limit to our expenditure, and within that limit we should secure, as nearly as possible, perfect efficiency. We should not allow this Frankenstein monster to grow and grow until our defence expenditure proves more disastrous to the community than would even the risk of a conflict. We can so overstep the bounds of prudence in this matter as to put such a grievous burden on this young community, which requires so much of its surplus wealth for developmental purposes, as will lead to nothing but chaos and disaster in the near future. For that reason I wish to sound a note of warning to those who think that because Europe is armed to the teeth we must necessarily emulate her example. The condition of nations which may at any time be called upon to take the offensive is vastly different from that of a community which is separated by thousands of miles from the storm centre, and which may never be drawn into a conflict other than one to repel an invasion by the coloured races which are settled to the north of this continent. If we take that as pur ideal, we may very well incur any risk that may result from any complications that may arise. "

- If they do not care to remain here and assist they can go outside. I thank them for nothing. The situation is this: The Labour Administration had for three years a continued political existence derogatory to itself and useless to others. It is so that the electors of Australia considered it when they had the opportunity to express their opinions on the 31st May last. The Liberal Administration was given power, with a slender majority, it is true. And the fact that we are few in number in the Senate is continually alleged against us as a crime. I think I may quote the historic line by a national poet which is placed in the mouth of one of his immortal heroes: "" The fewer men the greater share of honour.""

Senator Millen  very properly remarked that the people of this country hardly seemed torecognise what this war means. Australia has been classed by one of our poets as the only nation from "" the wombof peace, ' ' implying that we were born in peace, have grown to material prosperity in peace, and have become the inheritors of the most important part of theKing's oversea dominions in time of peace.

- Those of us who knew the late Honorable Albert E. Green intimately and shared his confidences find it extremely difficult to realize that he is no longer with us.  His  record of public service was more remarkable than the mere length of it, and that was considerable, for he served for ten years in the State Parliament of Western Australia and eighteen years in this National Parliament. An intensely earnest man, he took the problems of life seriously, as they shouldbe taken, and gave of his best in every department of those activities which constituted his life. We knew him as ""Texas"" Green; it was always difficult to think of him by his proper title - the Honorable Albert E. Green. He was a big Australian with a wide international outlook; his ideals of brotherhood, fellowship, and service to his fellow men were the guiding rules of his life. To all of us who knew him intimately, he was a good companion. He could be severe in his criticisms, but "" Texas "" Green was never bitter or uncharitable. He was an omnivorous reader, gifted with a wonderful memory. He loved poetry, and could recite with eloquence and great effect the gems which most appealed to him. Among my most, treasured possessions are some of the things which I have heard him recite and which I afterwards asked him. to commit to writing so that I might preserve them. 
 
Because of his wide interests and extensive travel, the late  Mr. Green  became known to many people as the honorable member for New Guinea in this Parliament.

From October, 1941, to July,' 1945, Australia was under the control of the Curtin Labour Government. Notwithstanding that that Government did not have a majority in either House of the Parliament, and that during its term of office Australia was in imminent danger of invasion, we came safely through the ordeal because of sound Labour administration. When the Curtin Government appealed to the people, in 1943, it was returned with an overwhelming majority. When the Government again went to the people in 1946, what was the result? It is shown in the composition of the Senate where we now have what we might term the "" three bears "" in Opposition. However, I emphasize that unless the people continue to entrust the Government of this country to the Labour party, we shall not achieve our aim of economic and social security for every section of the people for which the Labour party has fought for so many years. The aim of our party is to cater adequately for every section of the community. It is determined to bring about a more equitable distribution of the goods produced' in this country. We realize that depressions are caused by artificial measures. During the last depression, we possessed the things needed to build the human frame of every individual according to nature's specification. But what prevented us from doing so? It was simply financial policy. Unless Labour can continue to liberalize social services in respect of the aged, sick, infirm and unemployed, and help for those in need of assistance, we shall drift into another depression. Labour's aim, briefly, is that there must be a more equitable  distribution of goods and wealth among the people of Australia. We recognize the inalienable right of every individual to live a free and full life. In this respect, I have often told a story, behind which there is a good moral, and it will stand repeating. A boy, one of a very large and poor family, who used to go to church regularly, was found one Sunday crying bitterly. When the minister asked him, ""Johnny, what is wrong with you to-day?"", the lad replied, ""We have a new baby in our place "". Theminister said, "" You should not cry about that ; that is a happy event"". Johnny continued to cry, saying, "" Yes, that is all right, but we do not get enough to eat now, and with another in the family we will get less "". Thereupon, the minister said, ""Do not cry about that; the Lord never sends a mouth into the world unless He also sends food for it to eat"". Johnny replied, "" That is all right ; but He sends the food to your place and the mouths to ours "". The moral behind that story is that the National Government must make adequate provision to meet the needs of all our people and that is the goal of the Labour movement. 
 
This Government has made much greater provision for the welfare of exservice personnel of World War II. than was madebyanti-Labour governments for ex-service personnel of World War I. Over 4,000,000 acres have been approved for soldier land settlement under the Government's post-war reconstruction scheme. It is approaching that problem in a realistic way, and is taking full advantage of the experience gained in this sphere in the past. We have learned many lessons through the failures of anti-Labour governments in that direction. Over 2,000,000 acres have actually been allotted, and over 500 holdings are now ready for occupation. The expenditure already incurred in the acquisition of land for the settlement of exservicemen exceeds £2,000,000, whilst, approximately, 7,000 applications for agricultural loans have been approved. Over £4,500,000 has been made available for training of university type for exservice personnel, whilst loans totalling over £2,500,000 have been advanced for the purpose of settingup ex-service men and women in small businesses. Those results are in vivid contrast to the treatment meted out by anti-Labour governments to ex-service personnel after World War I. The Australian people will not forget those facts. They remember that conditions following World War I. reduced ex-service personnel to degradation. Men who fought in defence of this country experienced soul-destroying poverty in those calamitous years. We should remember that, prior to the out break of World War II., this country had been under the control of anti-Labour governments for 25 years. During that period, although we had man-power materials and everything, except the requisite finance, in abundance, our people experienced acute shortages of many commodities and were not provided with sufficient homes. Many were obliged to suffer starvation, despair and misery. The fact is that only during the regime of Labour governments has any progress been made towards the goal of every human being, namely, social security.. This Government has eliminatedunemployment. Its policy is full employment, and it is determined to maintain thatpolicy. The facts set out in the budgetpapers now before us show that this Government places human welfare before dividends and profits. Policies of the kind pursued by anti-Labour governments in the past must, surely, have inspired the poet to write - "

The well known quotation from the poet John Donne that 'no man is an Island, entire of itself, but everyone part of the main' should be the motto of every trade union and every business. One relies on the other; one cannot prosper without the full co-operation and help of the other and it is time we did away with the divisions between employer and employee. This is possible; it is done in other countries. Just recently it was reported that the workers in the Honda company in Japan voluntarily gave up 4 days leave because the company was behind with its foreign orders. This is not a one-way affair. The decision of those employees to give up their leave resulted in their company remaining viable and their jobs being assured. However, this can happen only where there is complete confidence and trust between employer and employee and where the employee does not believe that he is being taken for a ride. 
 
The co-operation and trust which exists between employer and employee should also exist between the elected government and its people. Yet we find that many set out to abuse the system. This is one of the many reasons for the high cost of our health care today. We all are paying for our health care either by way of a levy or through a fund contribution. So there is a tendency to get our money's worth. We feel rather cheated if we have paid out money and have not made a claim. So we demand our moneys worth. Consequently, many people have suggested that one way to contain health costs would be to provide an incentive to people not to abuse the system. What a terrible indictment of our society. Surely people must realise that they have had a good year if they have not had to make a health claim. If their contribution has gone to help less fortunate people that is just their luck. 
 
The Department of Social Security has had to employ field officers to check on the recipients of the unemployment benefit because many receiving the unemployment benefit would like to abuse the system- a system set up just 32 years ago to protect the unemployed and their families.  Senator Grimes,  the Shadow Minister for Social Security, has made quite a deal of criticism of investigations carried out by the Department. He claims that these investigations are set up only to harass the unemployed. We find that in October 1975 when his Party was in power, a particularly thorough investigation into this matter was carried out. As a result, 
 
I would now like to deal with the new violence that is creeping into our society. In the last few years we have permitted demonstrations to take place. They have been accepted as a way of airing grievances. It is no longer the done thing to air one's grievances in a democratic manner at the ballot box or by petitioning parliament. Instead we are permitting this minority which is opposed to parliamentary policy to try to inflict its opinion on the majority of electors. We have seen these so-called demonstrations turn into riots. Bricks have been thrown and damage to both person and property has occurred. When the police, who have tried to protect those going about their duties, do their job they are open to both physical and verbal abuse. We find that when they raise their hands to protect themselves the media take photographs and we read headlines screaming 'police brutality'. "

- Those who have become accustomed to dozing through the Speech from the throne would have missed nothing yesterday. After all, an administration which believes that the least government is the best government can hardly be expected to provide a feast of legislative goodies. But there is little comfort for the thousands of additional unemployed deliberately created by this Government's policies to be told that the 'Government rejects the notion that there can be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment'. The unemployed have been told, in effect, in the clearest possible terms, that this Government does not give a damn about them. 
 
The philosophy of the Speech was that in the fullness of time and with a little help from on high things will right themselves. Seeing that  Senator Walters  in her opening fantasy to today's proceedings about the condition of affairs in this country was moved to quote some poetry, may I proffer the suggestion that the Prime Minister 
 
The time is out of joint. Ah cursed spite! But I am damned if I was born to put it right'. However, a little attention to the words which the Prime Minister's speech writers put into the mouth of the Governor-General would have been repaid by the delicious little touch of irony which occurs in the closing passages of the Speech. The Governor-General, referring to the nothing promises that he had made earlier, said: 
 
By devoting all its energies to these goals, by emphasising those things that unite all Australians, my Government will strive to realise the hope and vision of every Australian- an Australia rich in opportunity for all its people to live the life they choose, fully and freely. 
 
That certainly jolted me out of my slumbers. Does the appointment to a well paid sinecure of a handsomely pensioned Governor-General, who was by common consent the most divisive figure to fill that post, constitute an example of emphasising those things that unite all Australians? The most dangerous problem facing Australia today is not inflation and it is not unemployment. As  Senator Button  pointed out in his thoughtful speech earlier in the day, the greatest threat confronting this country is cynicism- a corrosive, insidious, slow-acting poison. When a great number of people, perhaps a majority of citizens, believes that people in the highest places are liars and cheats, we are living in a sick society. But when most people accept that as the normal state of affairs we are living in a society which can only be described as decadent. I have observed in recent Press reports that the latest surveys show that the Prime Minister's popularity rating has improved. Admittedly the surveys were conducted before he told the greatest lie in what can only be described as the most mendacious - "

-This Bill gives effect to several matters. Some amendments will have the effect of liberalising some of the tax laws and some of them will be restrictive, primarily blocking tax dodges. One area that has not received enough publicity, I believe, is the provision that gifts of works of art to public libraries, art galleries, museums and to the Australiana Fund will qualify as tax deductions under more liberal conditions. At present a deduction may be claimed if the work of art has been purchased in the previous 12 months. The deduction is based on the cost to the donor of that work of art or its current value, whichever is the less. Consequently artists who wish to donate a work of art of their own are virtually stopped from doing so because the lesser of the two costs would be the costs of the canvas and the paint and not the cost of their time. The result has been that the arts have suffered quite considerably. I believe that government should encourage the arts and should encourage the giving of gifts so that substantial gifts held by families can be made available for public viewing. Many people believe that the arts should be self-supporting. I think perhaps the best way I can describe how I feel about the matter is to read to the Senate a letter which was published in the Hobart  Mercury some  time ago. It was written by Dianne Large, who says: 
 
Social welfare should encompass mind as well as spirit. Civilisations are judged in retrospect by their arts. Imagine the Greeks without their sculptures, plays and architecture; Medieval man without his cathedrals; the Elizabethans without their poets, playwrights and musicians; Italy without its art and opera. The effects of the arts reach out to all members of society, engendering thought, enlightenment, comparison and a sense of proportion- very real weapons against the materialism which is at the root of our declining civilisation. It is interesting to note that Marie Curie, when struggling in Paris, thought it worth going without food in order to visit the theatre regularly. There are no longer moneyed private patrons. Because, wealth, through taxation, is spread more evenly, the beneficiaries must shoulder the responsibilities that were once the duties of the rich. "

- I cannot cope with that particular comment. I come now to my two great parliamentary colleagues,  Senator Tehan  and 
 
Tom Drake-Brockman is our senior man, and we regret that he is leaving us. He will be our greatest loss. He was the leader of our party for many years. One cannot pay a higher tribute to a politician than to say that all members of the Senate, from both sides, are proud to count him as a friend. Tom is one of the select few who can be complimented in that way. In his 20 years in the Senate he has earned the acknowledgement of being a very astute politician. He has been a guide to many of us. He has seldom erred in his judgment, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate indicated, and he has never wavered in fairness in his position of  Chairman  of Committees. He has earned the respect of people who are his political friends or foes. 
 
He has the friendliness and the dry. infectious sense of humour that can be attributed only to a Drake-Brockman from Western Australia. He has been praised as being the ideal  Chairman  of Committees. He held that position for two terms and for nearly eight years in this place. From that role, with his ability to command respect and to facilitate the work of the Senate with an easy, no nonsense approach, he leaves the Senate today as a man who has gained in stature every year that we have known him. All senators would wish to speak on this occasion. My remarks are directed particularly on behalf of the National Country Party senators in this place. As I speak at 1.15 a.m., perhaps the most appropriate words, which I mentioned the other night, are those taken from one great poet. They are:

Humanity's drama of marvellous wrong. 
 
We have built up a committee system which is growing and has some purpose and prospect. But it will not mean anything if it does not correct the errors that come to us. Until we get out of the mists of this idea that we are restricted in money amendments the chamber will not achieve what it should. As I said in relation to another Bill tonight: We should be extricated from the Executive and have our parallel Executive. Of course honourable senators would not expect a man of such reconciliation purposes as myself to suggest any contention with the Executive but rather cooperation. We should have managers here. 1 can picture a Minister, as with two or three Bills tonight, having to explain his Bill in Committee and to argue his Bill. The managers would take part as Senate managers. But let us not argue the case for these things. I have done what I can for constitutional development. It is nice to remember that having been on the Constitutional Review Committee with a dissenting report in favour of maintenance of the Senate powers, in the only three referenda that have been put forward on this matter either by my side or by the Opposition, the majority of the Australian people, according to the Constitution, have not accepted the view that was put that the Senate power should be eroded. I shall be brief. I cannot forbear to mention though that Parliament is in a predicament. Democracy as Hailsham says is in a dilemma. In the old country the House of Commons has entered into a social contract with the biggest junta in the country and it is threatening us here. 
 

             Mr President, if you do not mind my saying so, in the law courts where I have practised now for over 50 years, I consider them to be not the agencies of justice but the opportunities for terror and ruin. We have a problem from the point of view of the law courts, the chief of which is to unify the jurisdiction as to which I see my friend the Attorney-General was in difference the other day with learned Chief Justices. That fundamental cause, unless achieved in the next 50 years, will give us a divided judiciary, as there is in America, to our great ruin. But everybody is waiting for me to speak about my parting from the Parliamentary Liberal Party last week. I have no apology to make nor do I have any pleasure. It was a situation that had to be met. It came to me with great regret after so many years. I take pleasure in looking back to 1949 when I took part in one of the greatest victories ever for our Party. It had great victories again in 1975 and 1977. I felt compelled to stand by my view on what was happening about a particular Bill. Notwithstanding that incident I stand here to acknowledge the cordiality and goodwill I have received from colleagues on the Government side and from all honourable senators on the Opposition side.

During the time of the French occupation the Slovene language was allowed to be used on the level of local public administration. However, this concession was not enough to stave off the Slovenian national revival. The French occupation was not the first provocation for such a move, since some 50 years prior to the organisation of the Illyrian provinces a Slovenian priest Marko Pohlin had sought to establish Slovenian on equal footing with German. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, Baron Zois - 1747- 1819- became the leader of an intellectual circle which included the historian Linhart, the poet Valentin Vodnik, who also produced the first Slovene newspaper, and the philologist Bartholomaus Kopitar who wrote the first scientific Slovene grammar in 1808. This group sought to achieve Slovenian cultural unity in the face of the various occupations, both physical and cultural, that the Slovenian state had suffered. The poet Franc Preseren further stirred the national consciousness of the Slovenian intellectuals and helped to achieve the re-Slavication of the Germanised Slovenian middle class. "

- The States Grants (Rural Reconstruction) Bill is, in the Commonwealth Government's view, a substantial measure aimed at relieving the physical and economic difficulties in which many primary producers find themselves at the present time. I believe the intention of this measure is very worthy and that it can be said to be one of very many measures which the Federal 'Government has adopted in conjunction with State governments to bring about agreements for the relief of this sector of the community. I believe this measure substantially has the support of the State governments. Publicity has been given to the fact that each State government accepts the scheme, and also the producer organisations have declared their support for it. Credit is due to the Federal Government and the State governments for their ready recognition of the problems facing our primary producers. It is obvious that in many instances our primary producers are just , not capable of getting themselves out. of financial trouble by their own resources and endeavours. Many of the troubles which progressively dog primary producers and which bring disaster are due to... circumstances beyond their control. 
 
We have heard members of the Opposition criticising the Government for its attitude towards the primary industries.  Senator Devitt,  who spoke so soundly in regard to rural problems which- he has faced in his State of Tasmania, pinpointed very well the problems which beset Governments and the producers. He said that when one is dependent on overseas markets one, is unable to determine what will be the state of the market in the near future. 
 
If a poet can write that Australia is a brown and sunburnt country and can go on to say that following flood, fire and famine it will pay us back threefold, then indeed the early 70s are the years in which primary producers will be waiting to be paid back threefold for the problems which they face today. Those producers who for three-quarters of a century have been the mainstay of Australia's export income and upon whose effort this country's economy has been built face at this time the lowest prices for their products ever known in that period. If we look at the most important industry in Australia, the sheep raising industry, we certainly see that the price for the fibre which is produced and also the price for mutton and Iamb are absolutely disastrous. 
 
The problems of the producers have been well aired in this Senate and indeed throughout this country. But perhaps for the first time - certainly for the first time to my knowledge - every sector of the Australian community acknowledges the difficulties which face the man on the land. Most of us support this very substantial measure of assistance which has been worked out with the wisdom of the Federal and State governments. I said that every sector of the Australian community acknowledges the difficulties of the producer, but we find the Australian Labor Party has now moved an amendment the initial words of which state that 'the Bill should be withdrawn'. I acknowledge to  Senator Willesee  that the amendment goes on to say that it is in order that something may be done. It is amazing that whilst we are able to say that the Commonwealth and every State government have agreed to the basis of this scheme not one member of the Opposition has said what the Labor Premier in South Australia has said. Has he asked for the withdrawal of the scheme? Not a sound is heard on this from the Opposition. It is just plain humbug and rubbish when supporters of the Opposition put forward this proposition that this measure should be withdrawn. The Opposition wishes the $100m to be withdrawn from the primary producers of Australia. Where would the Opposition put that amount of money? "

326,12/5/71,27,2,3,SENATE,1800,0,12/5/71,Senator LITTLE,KRU,Second Reading,bill,Victoria,,,0,0,"
 
- The Australian Democratic Labor Party supports these 3 Bills and congratulates the Minister for Works  (Senator Wright)  for saving the Senate's time by bringing them on together. In the essential fact of spending money on education they are identical, but in the different ways in which they propose to make grants to the States they each have a slightly different purpose, although all deal with education. The DLP supports the idea of a better education system and always has. Indeed, we can look back on a system that has been immeasurably improved in our own lifetime. At one time a person was very fortunate if he went to school beyond the age of 14 and 15 years and the possibility of a university education for anybody who belonged to what might be broadly described as a working class or middle class family was almost non-existent. But within one generation we have reached the stage where almost anybody who has the capacity is entitled to and gets tremendous assistance to have a university education that may take him through to his early 20s before it is required that he should obtain useful or gainful employment 
 
The DLP stands for that but it is a little worried that in spite of the tremendous leap forward we have made in a generation in this field it is obvious that a very small minority of the young people today are unappreciative of what has been done and tend to abuse and destroy the opportunities that are being made available to them. I am amongst those people who are horrified when they see photographs in the newspapers of places like Monash University, which was built quite recently - lovely buildings - at great Government expense, with slogans painted willy-nilly over the walls and government property destroyed. The cost of the damage is estimated to be $500 or $1,000. The students who have destroyed this public property which has been created for their use, the use of their generation and the generations to follow them then get a placard and scrawl on it: 'More money for education'. They then go out, march up and down the streets and complain about the generation gap and the fact that people do not understand them. 
 
I repeat that this is the attitude of a very small minority but, as this problem has been deepening and becoming more complex as the years have gone by, we feel that the time is over-ripe when governments must take some action, in the interests not of the older generation who have made quite considerable sacrifices to provide these opportunities but of the generation that is receiving the opportunities and those who will succeed them, to see that whatever problems young people feel they have they respect the property that is available to them for the purpose for which it was created - the education of students. This property is not theirs to destroy, because generations will follow who will also have the right, we hope, to use the facilities that we are providing. 
 
I maintain that this generation gap which is supposed to be responsible for so many ills does not really exist. I find no evidence to substantiate this amongst the members of good families who keep close together. I thought that there was a far greater generation gap when I was a young person when young people were supposed to be seen and not heard. Today members of families share their conversation; they share their knowledge; they share their interests with each other. The exception is in isolated cases where somebody - perhaps a parent - is falling down on his job. In my view, it is from these sources that we get this small vocal, noisy and noticed element that is giving the mass of young people a very bad name in the estimation of the older generation. The vast number of young people do respect the chances they have and are appreciative of the opportunities that are opening up before them to help them deal with the complexities of life in this modern age. We say to the Government that the time is long past when toleration of extremism is the solution to this problem. We believe that the opportunities for education must be granted only to those who accept them and who prove that they have the responsibility to make use of them in their own interests and in the interests of the nation. 
 
I agree with what  Senator Wheeldon  said about the education of children merely for the use of big business. I have never approved of that. But I think one can become over-enthusiastic and rather fanatical until the stage is reached where as has happened, some academics say that nobody should be educated for anything that is at all practical, that people should be educated for whatever they want to do. But we do live in an integrated community where no man is an island and each is dependent upon his fellow man. It is quite useless for us to send thousands of young people to the university to become philosophers or poets if nobody wants to employ philosophers or poets. Ii we did that, we would only be building up great tragedies for young people who may spend 3, 4 or 5 of the most important years of their life studying something that does not assist them in the general responsibility which we all have, namely, to earn a living for ourselves and for those who happen to be dependent upon us in order to see that a generation follows us. I suppose that fundamentally that is the primary responsibility of each and every one of us. I do not think that any individual should be able to drift off as an island on his own and say: 'I do not care if nobody wants to buy my philosophy after I have learned all about it. That is what I am going to be'. Then there are complaints because in our integrated society he finds himself living at a much lower level than the level he aspires to and certainly at a much lower level than a more practical person who accepts his primary responsibility to fit in with the scheme of requirements, not only of his own desires, but also of the desires and needs of his fellow man. 
 
We are among those people who counsel against extremism on every side. We certainly do not approve of our young people being trained only in technical skills that can be useful to big business. We certainly should discourage the young people who wish to concentrate their attention in areas in which it is obvious there will be a shortage of employment and a low standard of remuneration as compensation for years of study and a long period spent in acquiring the knowledge or skills that they have. In the field of education a philosophy is developing that because we spent too little for too long on education, it is necessary now only to spend more money on education and the problem will be solved. Of course, that is a falsehood. If the money is misspent and energy is misdirected our educational system will be no better than it was before we increased our expenditure on it. By the same token, if we spend money on the provision of facilities for young people, to be used in their interests and the interests of following generations, and those young people destroy the facilities, again we will have achieved nothing merely by spending money on education. 
 
I have placed those thoughts and philosophies before the Minister to indicate our views  on  expenditure on education. We approve  of  the Bills before the Senate, but we think h  is  high time that more attention was given  to  solving some of the practical problems  and to<  ensuring that money is not misspent  or-  facilities destroyed by young people who may be over-enthusiastic about  a  particular cause at a particular time, In supporting that cause they may think they have  a.  right .to destroy property that is not truly their own but is only for their use  and  the use, if they would only ""realise  it, of  their children and their children's children. If the trend continues it will be very bard  to  get our organised society  to  continue  to  accept the responsibility of raising the capital necessary to provide even more facilities and even better education  to  *be generations that are to follow us.

-  I am reminded of the oldest poem in the English language: 
 
Sumer is  icumen  in,  Lhude  sing  CUCCU 
 

             Mr Deputy President, on page  1095  of Hansard of 2nd November  1938, 10  months before World War II broke out, 
 
Defence expenditure must depend entirely, upon lbc conditions which prevail in the world from time to time. Obviously that must be the position. 1 say that any increase of defence expenditure after the Munich Pact so far as Australia is concerned appears to me to be an utterly unjustifiable and hysterical piece of panic propaganda.

- Yes, it would nave conscription. Switzerland is only a small country in size. Its population is 6.3 million and it has an army of 29,500 of which 24,000 are conscripts. But in addition there are a further 530,500 active reservists who can be mobilised within 48 hours. Now I turn to Sweden which, so I am told, is a model socialistic country. Its population is 8 million, about three-quarters that of Australia, and it has an army of 49,000 of which 36,500 are conscripts. But Sweden also has 100,000 reservists who are called up for from 18 to 40 days running each year. Belgium has a population of 9.8 million and an army of 71,500. Italy has a population of 54 million and an army of 295,000. Austria has a population of only 7.4 million but has an army of 44,000. With a smaller population than Australia, Austria will have a larger army than we will have as a result of the reductions proposed in this Bill now before the Senate. 
 
It should now be clear to all those who are fair that we do not have a gigantic army, not by any means. Countries smaller in population than Australia have larger armies. What is more, the countries I have quoted have greater security than we do. All this crying about national service training will get us nowhere. We need an adequate army, if we have any regard for the country and its future, for the children who live here and for future generations. If we cannot attain an adequate army of volunteers we will have to continue with compulsory national service training, no matter how inconvenient it might be. 
 
I repeat that every young man in Australia should be trained in the defence of this country. If our military leaders think that 18 months is long enough to give our young men sufficient training, well that is good enough for me. I am not an expert military strategist or educator but I know from long experience just how young men react favourably to the discipline and training they are receiving. I have had as many as 6 people, particularly mothers, come to my home when the previous national service scheme was in operation, worrying about their boys going into camp for a period. Some of them cried: 'Can't you stop my son from going to camp?' I said to them: What is your objection to your son going to camp?' They said: 'We are told that they have to sleep on boards. They have no beds, no stretchers, and the food is awful.' It was evident to me that they were over-indulgent parents. They thought their poor little dears were going to be very badly treated. At least some of them came back to me after they made their first visit to the camp one Sunday. They had a glow in their faces and they said: 'Our boys are happy out there. They say they are getting plenty to eat and they have stretcher beds to lie on.' A few of those women afterwards said to me: 'The best thing that ever happened to my boy was that period in camp. He came out better for it and was more manly. He learned to do a bit for himself instead of waiting on his mother to do everything for him.' 
 
A bit of training is good for us all. It is not possible to get a 100 per cent result. That is too much to expect. Even in our best schools that result is not achieved. As my poor old mother used to say: 'You will find weeds in the best kept gardens.' That is to be expected. If we love this country we should be prepared to serve it. It pro vides us with many opportunities, but God help us if we neglect it. As the poet,  Sir Walter  Scott, said: 
 
Breathes there the man with soul so dead, Who never to himself hath said This is my own, my native land!' "

The arts are among the factors which go to create a quality of life unique in Australia. In the past we may have been inclined to stress the physical and material satisfactions of life at the expense of the pleasures of the creative imagination. And as a result many talented Australians who wished to be painters or writers, actors or dancers, musicians or film directors have had to leave Australia to build a career in a more sympathetic artistic climate elsewhere. We could not afford this leaching of our society any more than we can now afford to allow our incomparable environment to be despoiled and polluted by lack of foresight and conscience. But, with the growing cultural awareness of the Australian society and because of support provided by Governments, the opportunities for talented Australians to pursue a professional career in this country have been increased significantly in recent years. While there is still much to be done novelists and poets, painters and sculptors can now command a better market as professionals here and abroad than they could do- not so many years ago. "

- I do not want to take it any further than to point' out that such people could murder a person today and they could not be charged - they would have immunity. I do not know why immunity should be extended to them. It is important that  I  raise this matter because 1 have failed sufficiently to persuade the Government of the need for an investigation. 
 
I want to raise another case in which it is alleged that the cause of death is unknown and that the identity of the victim is unknown. My reference is to the Sydney Daily Mirror' of 13th and 14th luly of last year which reviewed the case of an unknown man who was found at Somerton sands in South Australia on 1st December 1948. This man was buried unknown. The thing he had in common with  Dr Bogle  was that he died an unnatural death from an unknown poison. Every year flowers are placed on his grave in the West Terrace cemetery. Someone obviously knew and had some affection for this person. All identification marks were removed from his clothing. He had a scrap of paper in his pocket together with some incidentals which are not important to my case. The scrap of paper in his pocket was from the Rubaiyat' of Omar Khayyam. From the end of the poem had 'been torn the words Tamum Shud which means the finish or the end. The book from which the extraction had been torn was found in the back seat of a car in a public park. The Sydney Daily Mirror* asked: ""Was it suicide or was it murder?' On the back of the booklet was an 8-line 44-letter code which was marked out in code formation. Rather than take up the time of the Senate, with the concurrence of the Senate I incorporate the letters in Hansard. "

I think that we must consider the fact that we have lived for too long in a society which has not been very flexible and in which there has been a great desire to put people into slots. We see a life pattern of birth, school, work, retirement and death, a life style which that great poet, W. H. Auden, epitomised in the line: 'Sit on your arse for 40 years and hang your hat on a pension'. I think that that quotation very aptly illustrates the style in which we have tended to live in the first half of this century. I think it is a style which is totally inapplicable and totally unlikely to continue in the latter half of this century. The need which it seems to me that educationalists will have to fulfil and which governments will have to fulfil is that of increasing options for people at all stages of their lives. For the purpose of this debate, I have in mind increasing options in terms of educational opportunities of a diverse kind beyond the sorts of opportunities which have been made available to people in the past. 
 
I believe that it is important for us to try to make judgments about these sorts of things. I say in all humility that I believe that the present Government will make wrong judgments about some of these things and I am quite sure that if we were in government we would make wrong judgments about some of them too because they are terribly difficult issues on which to make judgments. But I put it to the Senate that in making those judgments it is very important that we understand and maintain the importance of a national responsibility- the importance of the assessment of national priorities as distinct from parochial priorities- and that we do not try to evade this responsibility in planning, coordinating and looking to the future as providing a richer educational opportunity for all. The calendar year of 1976 is, as I said, an interregnum period and  Senator Carrick  will acknowledge that the real sparks will fly at a later stage this year. But at this stage I wanted to introduce this note and take the opportunity of speculating a little about educational goals and priorities. Having done so, I commend the Bills to the Senate. "

-In my short time as a senator I have observed some rather interesting things, particularly in relation to education debates. I was elected to this Senate with a fair sort of background in the area of education. I came into a parliament which was spending enormous sums of money in the general area that we refer to as education. I was initially appalled by the lack of real interest that people in this Parliament took in what they were talking about. If one judges by the debates on education that take place in this Parliament it would seem that all one needs to be capable of making decisions on policy in relation to education is firstly to have been to school oneself; secondly, preferably to have had children who have gone to school; and thirdly- this is purely an option- to have witnessed at some stage or another students in an educational institution. 
 
We hear things expounded in this Parliament which more closely relate to poetry than policy on the subject of education. We have just heard a fascinating speech from  Senator Melzer.  I do not mean this personally, but I say in all sincerity that a lot of it would have been more appropriately set to music than delivered in a debate on education. It would have been more interesting to hear some comment on the subject of what education is all about. "

- On behalf of the Opposition I rise to support the comments of  Senator Withers  (Leader of the Government in the Senate) in his expression of sorrow on the death of  Chairman  Mao Tse-tung.  Chairman  Mao grew up in the old China of war lords, feudalism and foreign domination of trade in its major cities. He made a new China of independence, self respect, and international status. While commentators speculate about possible disruption following his death, Mao has left a stable Chinese social system with steady economic progress which his passing will not seriously disturb. 
 
When Mao was fourteen years of age he was married off, I understand against his will, in the feudal style of that era in China's history. Sixtyfour years later it was the same Mao who invited the anti-communist President Nixon to Peking, which was a significant step in easing tension between China and the United States and in bringing China into the realm of international relations. He was a young peasant organiser who stirred feelings of revolt against the tyrannical system of repression existing in his country. He was the philosopher who gave a new moral oriental form to Marxism. He was the brilliant military commander who won the populace to his cause by instilling in his troops a feeling of respect for the ordinary people. Unlike the armies of Chinese leaders before him, his armies did not loot, pillage or rape. He organised great land reform and just government. He was a poet in the classical style and a humane head of a government which was the biggest bureaucracy on earth. Throughout his life he remained a man of the people, living simply without the ornate trappings of office. 
 
China has lost its helmsman with the death of  Chairman  Mao, but his legacy of a unified nation firmly advancing the welfare of the world 's most populous nation and its emergence to its rightful place in international affairs remains with us. 
 
The Opposition regrets his death and expresses its sympathy to the people of China. "

I think it will be agreed by all honourable senators that the process of evolution has ultimately given respectability to those people who want to retain the best of the past.

- The sugar cane growers use both. Vegetable growers use both and people who irrigate grass use both. Contrary to the argument that has been put, the bounty will go to the better industries where, if anything, the use of these fertilisers can be afforded anyway. This is the complete reverse of the argument that has been put forward by the Opposition. I thought that the wording of the second paragraph on page5 of the report of the Industries Assistance Commission summed up the situation fairly well. A former Prime Minister on 7 June 1974 was responsible for referring to the Commission the question whether the Australian Government should pay a subsidy on manufactured nitrogenous substances used as a fertiliser and, if so, what should be the amount and duration of the subsidy, what should be the consequences of any assistance provided on the bases of maximum tonnage of fertiliser and what the tonnage should be. That is the basis of this legislation. These fertilisers are used by people who want them and need them but do not let us get confused by any fancy and hypothetical arguments about it. There is no abuse in the use of a highly priced commodity. Users will not waste it any more than they will waste fertiliser. 
 
The Opposition's argument about profitability and prices is quite invalid. If farmers are successful they will add more fertiliser; if they add more fertiliser they will probably employ more labour in their fields. They may even make more money, and if they make more money they will pay more tax and the profitability of many crops with or without fertilisers is such that the amount of tax users will pay into the coffers will be considerably greater than the pittance represented by the fertiliser subsidy. So the amount of money spent on the subsidy is of little consequence. The way in which the subsidy is used to help people who really need it was well summed up the day the superphosphate bounty was reintroduced in a poem which appeared in the  King Island News.  It summed up the general feeling. The poem was headed "

That is about the only reference he made to the Bill. He spent most of his time discussing the superphosphate bounty and reciting a poem which I do not think captured the interest of many people, except perhaps the line at the end which said that Mai was a great pal. To draw the logical conclusion from that poem the line should have read 'Mai was a great pal to himself and his wealthy farmer friends', because we know from figures that are available that Mai, the person mentioned in the poem, has been the recipient of at least $5,000 in superphosphate subsidy. I pointed out here yesterday that that amounts to 125 funeral benefits of which pensioners have been deprived to help pay for the bounty.  Senator Archer,  in his wisdom would not want to tell the people about that. All he wants to tell the people in the poem he read out is that Mai was a great bloke and a good pal because he has reinstated the bounty. Of course there has been a lot of argument on that. 
 

             Senator Archer went on to cite some figures, in answer to my interjection, about the use of nitrogenous fertiliser in the sugar industry. He said that that industry uses a lot of superphosphate, too. The figures show that the sugar industry uses 30 per cent of the nitrogenous fertiliser used in Australia; that the wheat industry uses 17 per cent, and 2 1 per cent is used in the production of other cereals. Anyone who has had anything to do with cereal growing knows that most of the nitrogenous fertiliser is used on sand hills so that a quick rye crop is obtained and sand drift stopped. It is not used to grow a good crop of wheat unless it is very poor land for cultivation. I think that knocks on the head the argument that was used by 
 
As the shadow Minister for agriculture,  Senator Gietzelt,  who led the debate, pointed out the Opposition supports the Bill which provides an amount of $12m per annum as against approximately $50m provided for in the superphosphate Bill that was debated earlier today. It is therefore important to demonstrate the vast difference in monetary assistance accruing to the large and wealthy producers who use this product as against the small amount received by the big majority of farmers who are in the main small farmers. That has been clearly illustrated. "

As the shadow Minister for agriculture,  Senator Gietzelt,  who led the debate, pointed out the Opposition supports the Bill which provides an amount of $12m per annum as against approximately $50m provided for in the superphosphate Bill that was debated earlier today. It is therefore important to demonstrate the vast difference in monetary assistance accruing to the large and wealthy producers who use this product as against the small amount received by the big majority of farmers who are in the main small farmers. That has been clearly illustrated. 
 
That is about the only reference he made to the Bill. He spent most of his time discussing the superphosphate bounty and reciting a poem which I do not think captured the interest of many people, except perhaps the line at the end which said that Mai was a great pal. To draw the logical conclusion from that poem the line should have read 'Mai was a great pal to himself and his wealthy farmer friends', because we know from figures that are available that Mai, the person mentioned in the poem, has been the recipient of at least $5,000 in superphosphate subsidy. I pointed out here yesterday that that amounts to 125 funeral benefits of which pensioners have been deprived to help pay for the bounty.  Senator Archer,  in his wisdom would not want to tell the people about that. All he wants to tell the people in the poem he read out is that Mai was a great bloke and a good pal because he has reinstated the bounty. Of course there has been a lot of argument on that. 
 

             Senator Archer went on to cite some figures, in answer to my interjection, about the use of nitrogenous fertiliser in the sugar industry. He said that that industry uses a lot of superphosphate, too. The figures show that the sugar industry uses 30 per cent of the nitrogenous fertiliser used in Australia; that the wheat industry uses 17 per cent, and 2 1 per cent is used in the production of other cereals. Anyone who has had anything to do with cereal growing knows that most of the nitrogenous fertiliser is used on sand hills so that a quick rye crop is obtained and sand drift stopped. It is not used to grow a good crop of wheat unless it is very poor land for cultivation. I think that knocks on the head the argument that was used by

- I am speaking about the superphosphate bounty. I would have thought that I was quite in order in referring to that because  Senator Archer  was allowed to base all of his speech- if one can call it a speech- on a poem on the superphosphate bounty. Surely 
 
Most of my remarks up to this point have been on the nitrogenous Bill. I have sought to have incorporated into  Hansard  yesterday and again today without success a list of the names of people who have been recipients of an amount of money calculated on 400 tons of superphosphate or more which they have received. Many of the persons and the companies named on the list which I have here are users of nitrogenous fertilisers. That is borne out by the document which was tabled in the Senate on 2 occasions. Although I have quoted from it once tonight I think it bears quoting again. Nitrogenous fertilisers are mentioned quite frequently in that document. The document, which was tabled on 9 September, relates to a survey of fertiliser sales under the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act 1963-1971 and the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Act 1966-1973. It states: 
 
This survey was undertaken in 1974 to inform the Minister of the extent to which users of fertiliser; both phosphatic and nitrogenous, benefited by $5,000 or more from the bounty and the subsidy in 1973. 
 
We realise that those figures are the only ones that are available. Under the Phosphate Fertilizers Bounty Act there is no way that the Minister can get the figures. He cannot say to the persons whom he asks to provide him with the figures that if they do not provide them they will not be recipients of the bounty next year. When I sought in this Parliament to get the figures and names of the persons who used superphosphate in 1974- the last year when the bounty was applied-  Senator Cavanagh,  the Minister for Customs and Excise, told me that there was no way that one could require the producers of superphosphate to provide the names because no bounty was applicable in 1975. That is the reason why we never got those figures. The bounty is now being re-applied.

We in Australia are in a very favorable situation compared with the people of Great Britain. We have goods that the whole world needs, such as wool and wheat. 
 
But Great Britain has to buy dear and sell cheap. Personally, I do not think that it has a chance of rehabilitating itself. I have said so before and I have brought down upon my head the reproaches of many people. The United Kingdom has to make up an adverse balance of £400,000,000 before it can balance its ledgers and it is not in the race to do so. It has lost its markets abroad. The source of its tribute from overseas has gone. As I have said, its machines and its mines are obsolete. If it sincerely hopes to recover its former position, its debt must first be wiped out. Some people say that war produces good results. No war has ever done so. Great Britain has been victorious in two wars, and we can see the situation in which it now finds itself. In spite of the shocking facts, people continue to talk about the prospect of a third world war. In its present economic situation, Great Britain cannot retain its Navy, Army and Air Force. Efforts are being made to establish a western union in Europe with the backing of the United States of America, but Great Britain cannot afford to pay the cost of such an organization. It is a top-heavy nation. There are parasites at the top drawing £10,000 a year or more, yet the people get only 2 oz. of bacon each a week. The nation cannot rehabilitate itself under such conditions. There is no reason why it should do so. Can members of the Opposition be sincere when they blame the Labour party for the situation that exists in the United Kingdom ? Had they and their kind been concerned with the welfare of the people during the last 300 years, Great Britain would be an economic paradise to-day. Yet the British people are being told that they must pull in their belts still more. One of the poets has rightly said - "

- They would have to come. Does the honorable senator believe that the Australian people who subscribe to the profession of their political leaders, that we will wage this war to the last man and the last shilling, would refuse to come forward if service to their country meant that they would not be paid ? I have a higher conception of their patriotism than that. As the member of the Imperial Legislature whom I have already quoted, has observed, paradoxical though it may appear, there are hundreds of thousands of men who will go willingly when they are compelled to do so. Many nien fail to recognise the need of the nation at the present time. They think that when the nation does not resort to compulsion the need for national service cannot be as pressing as we are told it is - that the situation cannot have in it any element of peril. Men are variously constituted. They are not all lacking in patriotism merely because they do not enlist, or those who enlisted only last week must be sadly deficient in this quality, seeing that they did not enlist twelve months ago. The men who will enlist three months hence will not be less patriotic than those who are enlisting now. Men's actions are, to a large extent, governed by environment. It is not every man who can cut himself loose, and say, "" Lo, I will go to the war."" At a celebration in Tasmania only on Saturday evening last,  Senator Keating  informs me that a  Colonel in  the Military Forces said that he would welcome a law which would compel him to go to the front, because there are certain circumstances which constrain him to remain at his present post. That is the position in which dozens of men ""find themselves to-day. They are not one whit less brave or patriotic than those who have been practically compelled to enlist because avenues of employment were designedly closed to them in order to force them to go to the front under an alleged voluntary system. Arguments such as these have been used by men who think as I do, right throughout the Empire. Only the other day a recruiting association at Cooma adopted a resolution in favour of compulsory service. There are organizations throughout the country which are at present passing resolutions in support of co-ordinated national effort. We talk about the beauty of voluntary service, and of the glorious valour of the voluntary Tommy. Who has sung the praises of the British Tommy; who has been his poet laureate to a greater extent than has Rudyard Kipling ? It was only the other day that I ascertained that Kipling is a conscriptionist. Who knows the emotions  of the British soldier as well as he does

.- I move- 
 
That the amendment be amended by adding to sub-clause  (3)  the following new paragraph : -  "" [c)  That in every ship registered in Australia or engaged in the .coasting trade where a library is provided for the use of passengers, members of the crew shall be entitled to obtain books therefrom under the same conditions as may regulate the issue of such books to the passengers."" 
 
Penalty (on owner) Ten pounds. 
 
I am aware that my proposal has not behind it the hallowed support of precedent, but we are not bound hand and foot by what may have been done in the past; and in making this departure we should only be doing what we have already done in connexion with many matters provided for in this Bill. I am moved to suggest this provision to enable seamen to enjoy the advantages of libraries established on board ship, because, for a very long time, they have been regarded as people of an inferior type. In my opinion, the time has come when this Parliament should do something to wipe out a class distinction which has been too long maintained. There are many instances in which employers of labour ashore have taken pleasure in furnishing their employes, in communities at a distance from centres of population, with libraries to promote their intellectual improvement, and it is not too much to ask that what is done in many places for trie benefit of employes on shore should be done at sea for the benefit of seamen. Those on board a ship at sea represent a self-contained community, cut off from association with other people. The master of a vessel is invested with judicial powers, can order the imprisonment of any. one on board the ship, and is, in fact, an autocrat of the most pronounced type. I can see no possible objection to libraries established by shipping companies for the benefit of passengers being used also for the improvement and edification of seamen. The sailor in the past, and to some extent tb-day, is very much the product of his environment, and the time has come when his environment should, as far as possible, be such as to lead to his improvement. Extensive libraries are provided on some of the large steamers trading to Australia, which are sometimes ten days away from communication with land ; but there is a forbidding notice posted on the library doors, and seamen or firemen dare not put a foot inside the sanctum, much less make use of any of the books. It is about time we altered such a state of affairs. There may be some opposition to my amendment, on the ground that it is novel and original, but I again remind honorable  senators  who take that view that we have already departed from precedents which no longer serve the purpose of the present age. I am not in the habit of quoting poetry, but I am disposed to quote, in this connexion, a few appropriate lines written by one of Australia's most respected poets, and dealing with the difference between "" fore "" and "" aft.""

- My honorable friend's countryman, and poet, Robert Burns, exclaimed, ""Oh ! Lord, gie us a good conceit o' ourseld  i""  There are none who should take that observation more to heart than my honorable friends opposite. Take the total cost of the Commonwealth Departments during a period of about ten years. I do not intend to cast any party reflection, because the figures will show that there has been an increase of a somewhat alarming nature in the cost of these Departments. To save time as much as possible, I shall give round figures. For the year 1902 the Departments cost us £3,733,000. In 1905 the expenditure rose to £4,322,000. In 1907 it rose to £6,162,000. In 1909-10, a year which I emphasize for obvious reasons, the expenditure rose to £7,449,000. By  1910-11  it had risen to  £13,158,000,  and in 1911-12 to £14,736,000. For the present year the estimate is £14,343,000. That is to say, from  1901-2  to 1909-10 the cost of the various Commonwealth Departments rose about 100 per cent. Averaging the nine years, the cost was  11  per cent, per annum, whilst in 1910 to  1913  the increase was 100 per cent., or at the . rate of 33 per cent, annually, which is certainly a most alarming increase. I shall deal with the  in.crease  of expenditure from another point of view after I have given other figures. I desire honorable members to contemplate these figures in relation to the position outlined to us before Federation. I have shown that the cost of the Departments has risen to more than ,£14,000,000. Whenwe went into Federation, the estimated COSt, as furnished by the ablest financiers in the Commonwealth, in a document which went forth to all Australia, and was published as a reason why we should not be alarmed about the cost of Federation, was that the expenditure incurred in the exercise of the rights and powers conferred by the Constitution would amount to £300,000. In plain language, that meant that the expenditure on purely Federal service would cost no more than £300,000 additional. It was further estimated that the cost of the services transferred from the States would be £3,005,400, whilst the revenue derived from transferred services would be .£1,755,400, leaving the net expenditure at  £1,250,000,  making a total expenditure of £1,550,000. When we compare the actual expenditure to-day with the estimate madeby the Federal Convention just before Federation, we must be inclined to feelings of alarm. It may be that the able financiers of that time were baffled in their efforts to anticipate the future; or it may be that it was not then within the power of any financier or statesman to anticipate what our needs would be under Federation; or it may be that, at last, the Commonwealth is practically in the control of a Government which has, so to speak, taken the bit between its teeth, and is carrying expenditure up to a point which threatens to wreck the Commonwealth. The principal sources of revenue upon which the Government rely for carrying out their work are Customs and Excise. I do not think it will be seriously disputed now that the burden of Customs and Excise is largely borne by the population as a whole. Whether they receive an equivalent compensation by the institution of industries is a question which, at this stage, neither the Government nor possibly the Opposition are prepared to discuss from a full-dress point of view. But the amount of taxation received from these two sources is certainly a very heavy one. In 1906-7, we received ,£9,648,000; in 1909-10, ^11,593,000; in 1910-11, "

The Council of Churches said, "" We would be content to give this relief to the mothers who give birth to children out of wedlock, provided that you give the money to us to distribute."" It was quite a laudable proposal then ; but when the State proposes to give the money without question or qualification - simply because a woman has become a mother, and registered the fact - the proposal is altogether wrong. The deputation to the Prime Minister were quite content that the so-called illegitimate mother should get this £$, provided that the representatives of the Council of the Churches had the handling of the money, but when it is to be handled by the State, it is altogether wrong. I do not propose to further labour the question. The Bill can be amply justified whether it is on the economic, . the humanitarian, or the Christian ground. Christ, when he was asked to condemn the sinner, absolutely refused. I suppose that every honorable senator has read the book of the Rev. Charles Kingsley, in which one of the characters is made to read a poem, which falls, after he is captured by the gamekeeper, into the hands of the squire, who reads it. In this poem, the Rev. Charles Kingsley - I forget whether it occurs in  Alton Locke,  or another book - states that a poor girl is condemned because she, to use a colloquial phrase, has fallen, and that perhaps the squire's daughter would have done the same thing if she had been placed in the same position. It is quite likely that she would. We do not know the temptations to which these people are subjected. We do not know the lengths to which they are driven by their squalid surroundings, or their environment, and therefore we should not be too ready to condemn them. At . any rate, there is no single one of us who has obeyed all his lifetime the whole of the moral law. There is not one of us who has not, at some time or other, fallen away from the paths of strict rectitude. There is not one of us who can say that he is the righteous person who is entitled to cast the first stone. There is not one of us who has not sinned in company with all these people whom our friends opposite are so ready to condemn. "

. - Some years ago I read a book by Lewis Carrol,  Through the Looking Glass.  There is one scene where, as Alice comes along, she sees before her an avenue which looks like a chess board. The red chess queen takes her hand, and rushes her down it, crying, "" Faster, faster,"" until at last she stops for want of breath,' and finds that she is at exactly the place that she started from, and on inquiring from the queen the reason for this, is informed she would have to run twice as fast to get anywhere else. That is a parable of the political situation of to-day. The public of Australia have ha'd considerable difficulty in following the political' vicissitudes that have taken place recently. Extraordinary political phenomena have resulted from the elections. The electors have shown- much uneasiness in relation to certain things  that have happened, and, rightly or wrongly, have determined that there shall be a 
 
Greeks never anticipated. Let us allow our imagination to flow back to Pericles and Athens. Could we join in the throng in the Agora, and meet the men of creative genius, those of the vision immortal, who were dealing with democratic principles, we should realize that the Democracy we have to-day would throw a challenge to their mental activities. Our Democracy is la thing very delicately adjusted and marvellously regulated. It was thus well for the Government to consider where their ship was heading before they came out to say, "" This is the policy we propose to deal with and enforce upon the people of Australia."" That policy wants a considerable amount of thought and care. They understand that progress does not come with a rejection of our cultural heritage, like that of Russia. We must  descriminate  between the real and the futile. In Russia we have a few persons taking hold of the reins of government and  showing  the people a rule analogous to the Asiatic despotism of the early Czars. The Government have to deal with the present-day Democracy, and it will require great thought and care on their part to bring down a policy that will be acceptable to the whole of the people. Stability, as I understand it, depends upon the elimination of misplaced static forces, and to master the graveproblems that confront them will require much consideration by Ministers. Time will not permit me to continue upon that phase of government, and so I turn to the second part, which, in my view, is the conservation of national strength. 
 
National strength does not mean only defence. It involves the proper utilization of our raw materials, the preservation of our timbers, the care of agriculture, the proper dealing with finance, and a right appreciation of our intellectual people, who will be prepared to aid the progress of Australia.  May I, first of all, say a word or two on the subject of foreign policy. Australia, as a result df the war, has cast aside her swaddling clothes, and has come forth in the habiliments of nationhood. She has won, as the result of her prowess at the Front, the right of entry to the councils of the nations of the world. She has ""been admitted to the Peace Conference, and enjoyed the right there to a voice and a vote in the framing of policies that were ito be of world-wide effect. We have been members of many Conferences and parties to many Treaties. We are a member of the League of Nations. During the time we have enjoyed membership of the councils of the nations, we have been represented by able men, possessed of excellent qualifications, fitting them to deal with matters of world-wide importance and urgency. We occupy a different position to-day from that which we occupied in 1914. In that year England declared war. When England declared war the sons of the Empire prepared to follow the old flag, and following the flag meant that they must tax themselves to find the money to fight, as Australians love to fight, in defence of what they believe to be right. The result of the action we took was that we were given a say in the councils that dealt with the conduct of the war. At the same time we assumed a responsibility that we as a people are now called upon to carry out to the utmost. As we have been permitted to be  members  of the Imperial Councils, we are given the right to a voice in determining the fate of the Empire. We have been given the right to a say in the framing of foreign policies which may have the effect of bringing about war. It is now possible that any of the units that go to form the Imperial family of nations may bring war upon the Empire. That is not likely, perhaps, but it is possible. Unfortunately, at the present time we have no machinery whereby the policy that is determined by the Empire can be expressed by a single voice. This SUKgests a matter referred to by my honorable colleague from Tasmania in connexion with Canada. That matter has, in my opinion, been far overshadowed by the  fact  that the Canadian people have 'been the first of the members of the British Empire to break away and make a treaty with another nation. They have recently made a treaty with the United States of America in respect to fisheries in which both nations are interested. If the people of all the units that form the British Empire begin to make treaties just as they feel in*  clined,then  we shall have a disruptive force at work that will send the 
 
Empire tottering as surely as the sun will rise to-morrow. It is not of the slightest use for Canada or Australia to imagine that as units they can expect to cut any figure in world politics. They each have tremendous influence as members of an Empire such as the world has never seen before, but the moment they propose to act independently of that Empire their power will become less. I therefore say that it behoves the Prime Minister tobring about as soon as possible an Imperial Conference that will speak for the Empire. To have a satisfactory policy laid down, as the result of consultation in an Imperial Conference between the representatives of the various parts of the Empire would be a natural evoluton of selfgovernment. A further evolution surely will be that we must take our share in the defence of the Empire. The Imperial Conference that dealswith these matters will have to consider how the Empire can best be defended, and must allot to the different nations forming the Empire the duties which it is essential they shall perform to insure that any defence of the Empire that is undertaken shall be effective. I therefore say that it is the duty of the Prime Minister to do what he can to forward the holding of an Imperial Conference as soon as possible, a purpose which I believe he has at heart. 
 
I want to pass from this matter for a moment to refer to our raw materials, and in this connexion I ask theGovernment to give every encouragement to our Bureau of Science. In it we have an institution from which science will improve our products, abolish waste, establish new industries, and reach out helpfully into all the activities of our nation. I remember reading at one time a lecture by Berthelot, and I was struck by two or threepregnant phrases, one of which was  Savoirc'est pouvoir  - to know, in order to do - which is the pragmatic test of useful knowledge. Our Bureau of Science can tell us what to do, because they know. If the Government are prepared to aid, the Bureau with money and encouragement, they will assist materially to lift the people of Australia above the plane which they occupy to-day. Man's one hope of salvation in this world is to overcome nature. When he left Paradise he was given a sentence of hard labour. As he began to evolve, he put the work upon horses and cattle, and, in some cases, upon other men. By the aid of science he has been able to discard some of his ideas of earlier days, and has invented machines which enable him without a great amount of physical exertion to accomplish great things. Unfortunately, history tells us, that the people who have benefited most by the introduction of machinery have had most to say against those inventions. In the earlier days of the Industrial Revolutions the people demanded that machines should be smashed. The poets of those times wrote songs about their waste and their danger, and even theologians thundering from their pulpits condemned them as ungodly and unholy. Magistrates on the bench denounced those things that were for the benefit of mankind. To-day that attitude towards the discoveries of science continues in a lesser degree. Although of such moment they are not appreciated here as they should be. At a great meeting in Atlanta City, in  1919,  a conference of working men, in force assembled, decided that the only way whereby the working man could benefit, and greater progress be accomplished, was by evoking the aid of science, in geology, agriculture, and mechanical appliances. If we allowour minds to revert to the earlydays of the last century, we will recall that, after the Napoleonic wars, when Germany had been crushed, her spirit ruined, her finances crippled, and she was generally in despair, Fichte suggested that, as her position was critical, her only hope of recouping her lost powers and rehabilitating herself amongst the nations of Europe was by means of scientific research. At the outbreak of the GreatWar she had accomplished this, and had placed herself in the forefront of the nations. Who will say that the Democracy of Germany will not be preparedto subscribe again to the doctrine preached over a century ago? If Germany survived her earlier misfortunes, let us not be crushed by any unfortunate mediocrity. We must be prepared to expend very freely on research for the benefit and betterment of the whole of the Empire of which we form a part. 
 
Let me pass to the question of national progress, which we have to look forward, to. To-day is the day of the machine. The machine is the great leveller. It is one of the powerful forces of Democracy. An aristocracy cannot be maintained without distinction in dress, and that only by sumptuary laws or costliness. Under our Constitution the firstis impossible, and the second is becoming rapidly impossible. For instance, rubies wero used to decorate the ladies of the earlier days at great cost, but now specimens physically perfect are being manufactured in Paris which conform to any test to which a physicist may submit them. These cost4d. a carat, instead of many pounds, as in earlier days. Lace, which was a symbol of aristocracy years ago, is now being manufactured from cellulose. The lace manufacturers engrave upon cylinders wonderful designs, such as the minds of the women of years gone by never dreamed of, and the material, after passing over the different cylinders, is turned out in long lengths of lace of beautiful pattern. In these circumstances, the possibility of an Aristocracy is reduced, and the prospectsof a Democracy raised. 
 
The Commonwealth is endeavouring, in the best possible way, to do what it can to aid the wonderful science of wireless telegraphy. Will any one endeavour or dare to say what the future of wireless will be ? A vessel in a fog can be directed by means of wireless signals, and wireless can be used in many other marvellous ways, too numerous to mention. Australia must move forward in this wonderful realm, and I sincerely trust the Government will not allow the Marconi octopus to throttle our forward movement in this direction. I appreciate the position of the members of the Government, some of whom were members of the Committee appointed to inquire into the proposed agreement between the Commonwealth and , Amalgamated Wireless (Australia) Limited. I am sure the PostmasterGeneral  (Mr. Gibson)  and the other members ofthe Cabinetrealize the great importance of wireless to Australia, and I trust the Government will do everything possible to make this Department a striking success, because itis along these lines that a great deal of the future success of our Empire lies. In conclusion, may I add that the circumstances under which the Government has been formed suggest that one should look for some analogy, and I am reminded of a chariot-driver and his horses.

- We differ on that point. If the Cabinet, in its wisdom, decides that Parliament shall stand adjourned, I do not think that there are any outstanding matters of sufficient urgency to call for condemnatory action on our part. 
 
Very curious opinions have been expressed with respect to immigration. A proper, well-considered, and welladministered scheme of immigration is absolutely necessary for the future of this country. It has been stated that the emigrants from the Old Country have not passed a sufficient test to ascertain their physical and occupational fitness for the duties they are about to assume. There are two essential requisites for the successful operation of any scheme of migration - first, that our emissaries who visit the Old Country shall not tell any lies about Australia; and secondly - and this is, perhaps, the more important - that immigrants who come to Australia shall not tell any lies about themselves. When these two conditions are complied with we shall obtain immigrants who will be a credit to the country and who will never regret having left the land of their birth - a country where there are many less opportunities - to settle in this fair land of ours, which offers opportunities for every one. 
 
Statements have been made that immigrants are likely to oust Australian workers from their occupations. That is evidently not the intention of those controlling immigration. I can speak, at all events, for those in authority in my own State. There we have, I think, as well thought out and as well developed a scheme as exists in the rest of Australia. It insists that the people who come to Western Australia shall be prepared to go on the land. We have there land for all. We have, furthermore, a system of group settlement, which, I think, is essential to the opening up of our great southwest country. Honorable senators from Victoria will appreciate the fact that group settlement is essential to the opening up of that country when I tell them that the nearest analogy I can find for it is the Gippsland country. Those honorable senators have a vivid recollection of the arduous task which the first settlers in Gippsland undertook. It was very difficult for any one to work the land singlehanded. Better work is likely to be  accomplished in this forest-clad country when thirty or forty men, with their families, are grouped together in a settled community, working together; cheering one another, keeping one another from feeling lonely and helping one another, than would be possible if the men were sent out to work single-handed. In such circumstances they would be likely, one by one, to become discouraged and brokenhearted. . 
 
The system of boy immigration has been mentioned, and Western Australia is well in the van in that respect. Eleven or twelve years' ago an enthusiast, who had chosen to "" eschew delights and live laborious days,"" inaugurated a scheme of child immigration into Western Australia, which is now bearing fruit. That gentleman is Kingsley Fairbridge,' a man of many parts, in whom we have the unusual combination of poet and (pugilist. He published' a book of excellent verse, and for two years was middleweight champion of Oxford. One would naturally expect a man of such attainments to be out of the ordinary, and that expectation has been realized. He established the scheme some eleven or twelve years ago, and it is increasing day by day. Orphan children, of ages varying from six to twelve years, carefully chosen by a committee in England, are sent out to . a farm school in Western Australia, where they learn the intricacies of Australian agriculture. They leave the school as Australians, and not as English people. They arrive in Australia at an age when they have no prejudices; they have much to learn, and nothing to unlearn. The success of the scheme is such that ever since the establishment of the school, whenever the boys leave, at ages varying from fourteen to sixteen years, and are known to be available for employment, .they are offered at least five or six positions. It is a wonderfully good scheme, and has been carried out principally with English money, with slight assistance from private subscribers and the Government of Western Australia. . "

Nathaniel L. Kentish, who called himself 'The Amateur Poet Laureate of Victoria', also issued in 185 1 a national anthem, on a broadsheet without music as did W. S. Jenkins in 1858. In 1854 S.

The state of Israel was established after many years of great suffering by the Jewish people. I believe that down the centuries progressive people throughout the world, whether Jewish or non-Jewish, have supported the rights of the Jewish people to a national homeland. Let us look back to the early part of the nineteenth century to Lord Byron, a poet whose contribution to human emancipation, in the view of some critics, would be at least as great as that of some of the people who have described themselves recently as progressives and leftists and who apparently think that Israel ought to be destroyed. Byron wrote: 
 
The wild dove hath her nest The fox his cave Mankind their country Israel but the grave 
 
The Jewish people set out to establish their own homeland to ensure that they had not only the grave but also a home in which to live, in the same way as everybody else has a home in which to live. I believe that in doing so they were carrying out the aspirations of all humanity. If Israel is destroyed it will mean not only that there will be another holocaust, such as the extermination of Jews which occurred under the disgraceful Nazi regimes of the 1930s and the 1940s, but also that it will be a blow to all humanity, a disgrace to all of mankind. I believe that this Parliament must make it clear that Australia will do everything that it can conceivably do to see that such a tragedy is not repeated. "

I said at the beginning that the Opposition has chosen in the last couple of debates on education in this chamber to narrow the debate very much, to narrow it specifically to the technical education area. We have had an extraordinary series of contradictions and waffly sort of argument in this area. On the one hand the Opposition is very wobbly on what it thinks about the commission which is inquiring into education and training. On the other hand it says we really must attend to the technical area and put a very much larger proportion of our resources into training people for jobs, because obviously that is an area of particular need. The Opposition cannot have it both ways. It cannot argue, that we need more resources for technical education because people need to be trained for jobs on those particular occasions when it chooses to move an amendmentas it has done today- on that very particular subject, and then on other occasions- as has happened here when we have had an education debate in more general terms- criticise the Government for looking at such problems as education and training. It cannot then say that we really are overlooking, as the Opposition has charged on various occasions, the great, large, stirring and wonderful meaning of education and that we ought to be educating plumbers in music and poetry, as has also been suggested to us on previous occasions. The Opposition needs to sort itself out on that issue. It needs to sort out whether it really thinks that technical educationthat is, the training for jobs- is something that is important and something into which a very much larger proportion of our resources ought to go. If it does, I hope it will desist in other debates on education from saying that we are giving too much emphasis to the technical aspects- that is, the job training aspects- of the whole education system. 
 
The Government's record, I suggest, has been good in this area. For some reasons, certain groups in the education arena have chosen to tell continual untruths about the Government's policy. There would never be a month go by, I do not doubt, but the New South Wales Teachers Federation's journal has some large article about an alleged reduction in education spending by the Fraser Government. It apparently pursues the idea that if one repeats something often enough some people, the ones who read only that source of information, will believe it. The Federation believes that if it is very lucky, what it says will come true. Perhaps it believes that if the Government is abused often enough - "

-I wish to make a very brief comment on the loss of former  Senator Theo  Nicholls. He was one of the first people from another State who contacted me when I first arrived here in 1965. He made a very big impact. That was the first time I had met him. One of the things he said at that time was: 'If you lose the ability to laugh while you are in the Parliament you might as well give it away now.' That was the way Theo looked at life generally.  His  ability to memorise long tracts, which was mentioned by my 2 colleagues, was quite outstanding. He could also remember poems of probably 150 verses. I think that he compiled some of them because there were no existing pieces of poetry that were long enough for Theo to apply his fantastic memory to. 
 
In relation to the other anecdotes told by my colleagues, I am told-and this is on good authority- that on one occasion when he was called upon at short notice to make a speech, he actually took it from a  Hansard  from the other House. He thought the speech had some validity and was of fair quality so he memorised it. The person who had made the speech had introduced the subject in the lower House. The person was in the gallery because he wanted to find out how the debate was going. He listened to Theo speaking for some five or 10 minutes. He thought the speech was very familiar and that he had heard it somewhere before. At the end of some threequarters of an hour when the speech had been completed without the alteration of a full stop of a comma, he realised it was his own speech that Theo had been using in this place. He came around to compliment Theo on the quality of his speech, but Theo was not admitting that he had nicked the speech from the 
 
I believe that it is people of this character who contribute in a great way to the democracy that should live on in both Houses of Parliament. Theo Nicholls mixed well with people of all parties. He appeared not to have any enemies. He had a very acid tongue which he could use when he wanted to do so. Right from an early stage we formed a friendship. Each year we exchanged birthday cards. His birthday and mine were close together. We also exchanged messages at Christmas. I will miss that. I had a birthday card for Theo ready for posting this year. I cannot now send it, of course. I join with my collegues in supporting the motion generally and in particular I express sympathy to the surviving family of the late Theo Nicholls. "

The other person whom I know at all well is, of course, Tim Thorne. Tim Thome is an ex-teacher and a poet of some repute- a poet who in fact can get his poems published, which is very unusual in this country. I was unable to contact him today because he is in Sydney seeing his publisher. Tim Thome is a very radical member of the Labor Party. He never makes any bones at all about it. He publicly states his views. He does not hide his views. I understand that tonight he has issued a statement saying that he has never been and is not a member of the Communist Party of Australia, and he also has challenged  Senator Harridine  to say outside this Parliament that he is. 
 
That is all I wish to do. Some of those people I know well. Some of those people I do not know well. I am sure, as far as I can be sure in the short time I have had today, that everything I have said here tonight is correct. We have a principle in this country. I believe that people are allowed to express their views and to express them openly, but we should not allow people to be condemned because of guilt through association as we heard in the speech last night. I merely wish to get on to the record of this Parliament further details of the people who were mentioned last night and to correct some of the inaccuracies in the speech last night. "

- We always get these interjections. It is claimed that a Labor Government that was in office for a mere 3 years is responsible for all the ills that have befallen Australia. According to some people there were no problems before 1972 and that every problem we have arose between 1972 and 1975. That is simplistic and quite out of character with the type of thinking that ought to be developed in looking at this problem of housing. Even when the Australian Labor Party came into Government in November 1972 the facts are that the highest number of people in the history of Australia required public housing. Because we recognised this we took steps to correct the situation and we channelled the largest amounts of funds ever into the housing sector through the Housing Corporation to the States. We adopted a housing policy aimed at reducing house prices and providing welfare housing for more Australians. Surely it cannot be argued that the high cost of land, which is a component of housing costs, can be attributed in any way to the brief 3 years of a Federal Labor Government. The responsibility for providing a stock of land for housing rests with the States. The position is not made much better by a Liberal Government or a Labor Government. We know that it is a product of a market situation. The Housing Corporation was designed to overcome the backlag that had accumulated in housing. Steps were taken to provide housing for that section of people who did not qualify for public housing and could not afford loan repayments because of their financial means. One of the first things the Fraser Government did was to disband the Housing Corporation when it won office in December 1 975. 
 
Whilst the Liberal and National Country parties have instituted a variety of substitute schemes aimed at assisting Australians to obtain home ownership it cannot be denied that the result has been unsatisfactory because there has been a deepening of the recession in the housing and building industry. No sweet rhetoric by Housing Ministers or Ministers for Construction will change those basic facts or that basic problem. I suggest that those who think otherwise should go into the field and discuss the matter with those builders who are endeavouring to sell the great stock of homes that is available in all the capital cities of Australia. Young couples today are confronted with fewer home ownership possibilities and many of them are paying up to 80 per cent of their total weekly income, that is the income of husband and wife, to obtain housing. One never hears about this from the moralists who keep talking about the family unit, the breakup of the nuclear family or the problems of zero population growth. One never hears the fundamental approach that needs to be taken in this area of trying to establish what are the economic factors that force that sort of situation and make a double income the basic means of obtaining a house or other accommodation. 
 
The Labor Party, when it was in office, was criticised for distortions in house prices that took place during its term of office, particularly in the capital cities of Sydney and Melbourne. It must be emphasised that in no way could these distortions be attributed to Australian Government policy. Recent reports in the  Australian Financial Review  and other newspapers have pointed out who were the real culprits of the property boom. It had nothing to do with the Federal Labour Government. The boom raised the price of housing well beyond the reach of the majority of Australians. In the late 1960s and early 1970s large companies pumped into the property market huge sums of money which pushed up prices. The volume of money used is indicated by the subsequent enforced write-down of assets of companies. I want to refer to a small number of these which contributed towards this problem. It was not the mere election of a Labor Government. The Abbey group has had some $ 140m in property investment the subject of a write-down. IAC (Holdings) Ltd, the biggest property development house, has had to reconsider the value of its capital assets, and calculations made indicate that the value should be reduced by some $60m. The actual write-off of property over 2 years has been $2 1 .4m. Parkes Development Pty Ltd was a property developer which comprised some 70 companies. It has gone into liquidation. The current value of assets is expected to be far below the book value of $100m. These companies were well established and did a great deal of land development, housing development and speculative development. Commercial and General Acceptance, commonly known as CAGA, has has some $24m in property investment the subject of a write-down. FNCB- Waltons Corporation Ltd has written off some $6m from its property loans since 27 January this year. This is only the tip of the iceberg of the problems facing Waltons as the sum represents a mere 10 per cent of its problem loans. 
 
Therefore the need is apparent to place housing beyond the manipulation of companies which because of their concentrated strength and purchasing power are able to exploit the market. It is ludicrous and totally erroneous to believe that this problem accrued just because there was a change in government in one State or in the national arena. The acceleration of prices for homes, home units and land which occurred during the boom ultimately was to the detriment of home owners. We are talking about a period of approximately 20 years when the big land boom took place, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. It is poetic justice that so many of the large developers themselves have been caught up in the same exploitative trap as they set for others. Needless to say, the Australian public suffers more than these large corporations, because the losses have to be paid for by somebody. They are paid for by the community not only in the losses that are sustained but also in the lack of confidence that is created in those people who might otherwise want to invest in the activities of those corporations. Contrary to the views expressed by  Mr McLeay,  the Minister for Construction, the recession in the building industry has not ended. The Government has not solved the housing problem, and by not releasing adequate money has deepened the recession in the industry. 
 
We regret that the Government has seen fit to amend this piece of legislation because it was the Government that introduced it in 1965. The Opposition cannot understand why the legislation should now be bent to accommodate the private sector. The argument that there should be selective stimulation for the housing industry in New South Wales remains unanswered. The number of new houses commenced in New South Wales in the December quarter fell by 25 per cent. I am sure that no honourable senator will suggest that this is because  Mr Wran  was elected Premier on 1 May 1976. After 18 months of Wran Government the private sector has not provided adequate stimulation for the housing needs in New South Wales. While the position of other States is perhaps marginally better the prospects in New South Wales are that there will be no immediate improvement. Only Federal Government initiative of the type responsible for this legislation being introduced in 1965, will cause some improvement in the general building industry in this country. 
 
The sooner we put aside party political differences that so often emanate when in the Senate we discuss the housing problems the sooner we look at the problem as a general problem and not as a political problem and the sooner we provide adequate finance to stimulate the building industry the sooner we will have the sort of response that is necessary to return to the position where nine out of ten Australians who want to own their own home will have the opportunity to do so. In conclusion, the Opposition does not propose to oppose this Bill although we are critical of the constrictions and restrictions that are to be placed on this very important Housing Loans Insurance Corporation.

-I should like to associate myself with the expressions of sympathy and condolence to the wife and family of Leslie Haylen. During the years that Leslie Haylen was in this Parliament he always projected to me a picture of a man of great sincerity, an earthy man who knew the way the country should go. But of course, unfortunately, he did not remain in the Parliament long enough to participate while his party, our party, was in government. But in the advisory areas of our party Les Haylen was always highly respected. He was a man who had a great ability to express himself with humour and with earthiness. Perhaps I might recite to the Senate a very telling poem of his titled 'Inflation'. It went this way: "

I put that on the record,  Mr President,  because it indicates the attitude Les Haylen had towards events. There are a lot of telling lines in that poem. He was a man who came to grips with reality. He was a man who was very much loved by the members of his party. I know of the respect and admiration in which he was held by the party in New South Wales.

-I should like to be associated with the expressions of condolence that have been offered by members on this side of the House at the very sad passing of Les Haylen. I, like my colleagues, had been associated with him for more than a generation- some 25 years or more. I cannot match the eloquence, although my personal files show many poems of the calibre and capacities, of the poem that has been so ably presented by  Senator Justin  O 'Byrne. This is probably not the time to refer to those poems because they deal with some of the internal matters of the Parliament and of the party to which we belong, but they are rich in humour, they are rich in relevance and they are rich in the folklore of the development of the political and social movements of our country. Les Haylen, of course, epitomised the very rich experiences of the political life of our country. He was a journalist of great repute in the 1930s and 1940s before he came into this Parliament, and I think he brought into the Parliament a great sense of humour and wit as well as courage and conviction, which so often are lacking. I think that sometimes we forget the brighter side of life, the side of life that Les 
 
Haylen was always able to bring to a political debate or to some of the internal matters which affect the party to which be belonged. 
 
It is true that he served the people of Australia in this Parliament for a little more than 20 years, and they were difficult years from the Labor Party's point of view. Les was an innovator, an initiator, a goer, if I may use that expression. He wanted to see things changed; he was about social change. Yet he lived in a period when there was not a great deal of movement for the things in which he believed. Nevertheless, he never lost his faith or his belief that changes would be made. I think it is probably true to say that he was a casualty of the Vietnam war in the sense that it was because of the struggles of the 1960s that Les lost his seat in one of those pendulum swings that are notorious in Australian politics. He then sought to come back through the Senate, but because of the activities of the extreme Right in Australian politics, he failed to gain a place in this august chamber. I have no doubt that if he had succeeded he would have enlivened the proceedings and he might well have been a member of this chamber when he died had he been elected on that occasion in the mid-1960s. 
 
He was a prolific writer, as my colleagues have suggested. He was associated with the Australian Book Society because he believed in the principle that Australians should write about their experiences. He wrote many books, some of which were published by the Australian Book Society of which he was an honoured member. On one occasion I think my colleague  Senator Douglas  McClelland assisted in a function associated with that organisation, to which Les had given unstinting and unselfish service. It is getting to be something of a habit in this place in recent times to pay tribute to departed comrades of the Houses of Parliament, whether it be the House of Representatives or the Senate. I hope that we will not be required to speak of another of our late colleagues for a considerable period of time. The Parliament itself loses by the death of its distinguished members, and I am sure that we can put Les Haylen into the category of having been a distinguished member of the Opposition. In those circumstances, I am sure that we would want to pay our tribute to him. To his family, who lived with him in Summer Hill for a great number of years, I extend not only my own personal sympathies and condolences in their sad loss but also those of all members of the Parliament and certainly all members of my own party. I can only express the hope that the members of his family will draw some consolation from the  fact that the prestige which Les enjoyed in the Parliament has been recorded today in the expressions of condolence.

That is what I have always understood it to be. I know my wife is a subscriber to it. Its editorial board, as I recall seeing the names listed, has on it some very distinguished people. The late Professor James McAuley, one of Australia's better known poets, was editor for many years. I think Professor Leonie Kramer, a very distinguished professor of literature in Australia, is a member of the board.

. - I notice that the Government has estimated that expenditure by the Department of Commerce and Agriculture will be £103,200 more this year than the vote for 1947-48. The department is responsible for matters which vitally affect men on the land. At present, over a great area of Queensland, graziers and farmers are suffering severely from drought. They are caused a considerable amount of extra worry and financial loss by the acute shortage of wire and wire netting. We earn a lot of dollars from the sale of rabbit skins, and it would be only poetic justice if the dollars which rabbits earn for us were converted into wire netting in order to preserve rural properties from the ravages of rabbits. In many parts of Queensland, high losses are also caused by the depredations of dogs and dingoes, which will continue until adequate stocks of wire netting become available. I urge the Government to give serious consideration to releasing additional dollars for the purchase of urgently needed wire and wire netting by our primary producers. "

 States in the Senate remains equal. I see no reason why the membership of the States in the Senate should not be reduced even to two, if such a course were thought desirable, provided that the representation of each State was the same. 
 
The remarks to which I have taken exception, emanating from the House of Representatives. give us food for serious thought, because we must realize that they would not have been uttered had the dignity of the Senate not already been considerably impaired. If the Senate were fulfilling the functions for which it was designed there would not be any occasion at all, even mistakenly, to give utterance to those sentiments. So, we might examine our collective conscience, and also the doings or misdoings of those who have preceded us in this chamber, to see whether there is anything that we can do to rehabilitate the prestige of the' Senate. I submit that the lack of appreciation of the dignity of the Senate has been contributed to largely from time to time by some members of the Government. Too often, in reply to courteous and intelligent questions, we on this side of the chamber get smart answers* - and I use the word "" smart "" as distinct from clever or wise. These "" smart "" answers receive the servile approbation of certain Government supporters such as the leader of the "" push "" of poetic fame would expect from members of his mob. I could not care less about the personal attitude of member to me, but that is not the point. The -point is that I am one of three senators who represent 48 per cent, of the electors of the Commonwealth, and if I submit a reasonably topical, courteous question I expect an enlightened and courteous reply. That has not always been given. Another matter which I think has contributed vastly to the deterioration of the prestige and standing of the Senate, is its tendency, in the last 30 years, to become a mere rubber stamp for the House of  Represent,atives.  We have lost the character of an independent chamber. The Senate is no longer a. council of States and the champion of State rights. It has become merely an echo of the lower house, and so long as that state of affairs continues I defy any honorable senator to advance a satisfactory reason for its continuance. Unless we can assert our rights and endeavour much more effectively to fulfil the role designed for us by the framers of the Constitution, we shall have great difficulty in justifying the existence of this chamber to our electors. Let us consider what has caused this state of affairs. I shall quote a few passages from the proceedings of a Senate select committee, as recorded in the  Journals of the Senate,  Volume 1, 1929 to 1931. They consist of evidence given by former "

. - The PostmasterGeneral  (Senator Cameron)  has not yet given me a satisfactory explanation of the amendment proposed to be made under this clause to section 67 of the principal act. Under that section very onerous obligations are placed upon the licensees of commercial broadcasting stations with respect to accounting to the Minister. Paragraphs 
 
make available for inspection by the board or an authorized officer such books and documents concerning the broadcasting activities of the licensee as the board specifies; and; 
 
furnish to the board such particulars with respect to the broadcasting activities of the licensee as the board specifies. 
 
In the absence of any explanation of the inclusion of this provision we must impute sinister motives to the Government. What activities of broadcasting companies does the Minister suggest should be disclosed in their accounts? Of course, it is inevitable that intimate relationships between broadcasting stations and their clients will be revealed. Every conceivable reasonable power to exercise legitimate supervision of the activities of commercial stations is already enjoyed by the Government under section 67 of the present act. The enactment of clause 19 of the bill will enable a Minister, who may be infuriated by the political attitude of a particular broadcasting station, to  require that station to reveal to his jaundiced and biased eye its intimate business relationships so that he may penalize it if he desires to do so. I see in that provision a very real danger in that commercial broadcasting stations may have to submit their legitimate transactions to a ministerial inquisition. Although it is only reasonable that a commercial broadcaster who holds a licence to broadcast  from the Government should be subject to reasonable supervision, there is no justification for the introduction of such a drastic provision as clause 19. From my school-days I remember the line written by the poet Campbell -

I am sure that the full facts and circumstances associated with it have not yet been placed before the chamber. I hope that either honorable senators who follow me in this debate, or the PostmasterGeneral  (Senator Cameron),  in reply, will give the chamber much of the information which, at present, it does not possess. I am hoping also that, during the remainder of this discussion, honorable senators will forget their party allegiance and place the interests of their country above the fear of party tyranny and discipline. After all, honorable senators opposite have a noble tradition. There is legislation on our statute-book of which the Australian Labour party has every reason to be proud; but how disappointing it -is to see how far members of that party have departed from the traditions established by its founders. There was a time when Labour leaders were pledged to strive for and, indeed, fought for - to use the expression of a Queensland poet - "" a larger measure of right for the mass of their fellow men "". They fought, and fought hard, for that "" larger measure of right "" ; but, above all, they were actuated at all times by a keen appreciation of the value and sacredness of personal liberty. Not only did they fight valiantly, hut also they suffered in that fight for a ""larger measure of right and for the assertion of personal liberty and personal dignity.

- I am saying that this marginal dairying industry is involved in  a  question of land use. 
 
I want to recollect to  Senator Webster,  as a senator from Victoria, that this has happened 3 or 4 times in Victoria. The problem is one of effective land use in the context of the economic circumstances and the social circumstances that exist at ihi time. If the honourable senator will allow me to continue and does not break the thread of my argument - to use his own phrase - in the 1.890s. after the breaking up of the land in the 1870s and the bank crash of 1892, the land was reconsolidated. In 1919, it was broken up again for soldier settlement. It was reconsolidated because of economic forces and pressures between 1921 and 1939. From 1947 onwards, the land tenure system of Victoria was broken up again, in 1953, when I ended my first appearance in the Senate and when one of these Bills relating to the dairying industry was before the Senate, I made the prophecy that that Bill which related to the equalisation fund would be perhaps the last to be passed. I said that the Australian dairying industry was involved, as were all other elements of Australian primary industry, in the problem of land use. 
 
remember 2 years ago addressing 800 indignant dairy farmers at Shepparton. I would sooner face a hostile Senate than 800 indignant dairy farmers or 800 indignant farmers of any kind, for that matter. I remember quite clearly staling to the dairy farmers in Shepparton that the Victorian dairy farmers had no worry because they were an efficient section o£ the Australian dairying industry because the land in south-eastern Australia naturally lent itself to dairying. The present Bill deals with the areas of the Australian dairying industry into which, unfortunately, people have been cajoled by the promises of politicians for electoral purposes. They entered into areas where the land could not effectively support a dairying industry in economic terms, as 1 understand it. 1 add, if I may, as a measure of what I believe to be true in terms of personal experience, that on marginal land I have attempted 3 times - backed by what was alleged to be scientific knowledge of land use - to establish dairy farms. I have had 3 attempts and I have lost money on every one of them. I claim at least to know something about dairying, even if I do not know much about politics. 
 
I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that we are involved in this problem of the effective use of land. In cold, economic terms, this is clearly demonstrable in the terms of this Bill. We are also involved - as indeed I am involved - in a romantic or an emotional problem which, I think, is pervasive in the Senate. I am constantly reminded, whereverI go, of the poet who who was writing of circumstances similar to those in which Australia finds itself today. He wrote: "

Is the Government aware of the public circulation of a booklet titled 'The Vestey Story', which gives chapter and verse of the massive inroads made by the Vestey group into Australia's commercial life? Does the booklet state that the Australian Aboriginal poetess Kain Walker, on a recent visit to London, questioned Lord Vestey about the refusal of his company to return tribal land on Wave Hill station to the Gurindji tribe? Did Lord Vestey, according to the booklet, tell  Mrs Walker  that Vestey's interests in 
 
Australia were in very good hands as far as politics were concerned - those of  Mr Peter  Nixon, Minister for the Interior? Will the Government refute these alarming allegations that a Minister controlling Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory is looking after the interests of a foreign owned company, and will it do so in the most effective way, that is by granting the Gurindjis the land rights they seek at Wave Hill?

So as to bring the poem up to date I have, with great respect to the writer of it, altered a word here and there to fit in with present day conditions as they affect the Senate.

I  have made a few alterations to fit the position as it is today in this chamber. I suppose that poem was one of the greatest propaganda poems used in the conscription of 1916 and 1917. It caused some storm then and in my opinion it fits very admirably indeed the two senators that  I  have named. 
 
It is quite easy for them to vote for conscription of 20-year-olds - some of them, unfortunately, to bc killed. Only the other night I read a report in the 'Herald' that the casualties up to date amongst Australian soldiers in Vietnam total 3 SO dead and 1,819 wounded. Is it not easy to send someone off to war? What for? The Government that honourable senators opposite support has not even declared war. Why has it not declared war? Surely one cannot say that this is other than war when such numbers of our young men are killed or wounded. Does the Government not declare war in order to protect the people who have gained most out of war over the years, whether it be this, that or any other war? We can go around living our lives without any extra taxes and without any burden at all in order that for some whim, some alleged request by - I suppose - one of the worst governments that the world has seen, as proved by what the Americans did- "

- I take this opportunity to congratulate  Senator Douglas  Scott on the making of his maiden speech. He is a member of the Australian Country Party and I am proud to be a member of the 
 
Labor movement. But at least we have 2 things in common: Firstly, we have the same christian name and, secondly, we both represent the State of New South Wales in the National Parliament.  Senator Douglas  Scott comes from the Grenfell district of New South Wales, which was part of the beloved country of a very great son of the Labor movement, Henry Lawson - the man who wrote the immortal Faces in the Street', 'Wait Here, Second Class' and many other great poems that had a profound influence on the thinking of the Labor movement. Although I disagree with 
 
If ever a document that highlights to the Australian people the incompetence of this Government and its inability to face up to the very great and growing problems besetting this nation was presented to the Australian Parliament, it is the Federal Budget which was presented recently by the Federal Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth  (Mr Bury).  The Budget shows that the Government is not only a government without ideals but also very largely a government without ideas. It is a government that is guided in its actions by dollars and cents, with little, if any, regard for human values. 
 
This is the era of the 1970s in which Australia certainly has to get with it. There was a time in Australian history when we knew what Australian governments and Australia as a nation stood for. Our pioneers of the nineteenth century were proud of the society they were moulding and were guided by ideals because they had learnt so much from the past. They were men and women who believed in social justice. Indeed, for several generations this great nation was in the vanguard of social reform throughout the world. But, as I look closely at the Budget Papers presented by the present Treasurer, I see in them no evidence that this Government believes in social justice or that it is prepared to face up to the need for social reform in our society of the 1970s. In fact, the Government itself admit1;, to use the Treasurer's own words in his Budget Speech, that inequity has grown into the taxation system. 
 
True it is that under this Budget taxpayers on incomes up to $10,000 per annum will receive a reduction of 10 per cent in the amount of tax payable. Bui the inequity has existed for 14 or 15 years, as acknowledged by the former Treasurer,  Mr McMahon,  and also by the present Treasurer, 
 
Postal charges in the aggregate are to be increased by about S53m in a full financial year. Charges for telephone calls and rentals, stamps and other services provided by the Australian Post Office are to be increased. These increases are all passed on to consumers. Sales tax is to be increased by 24 per cent on some items. The excise duly on petrol has been increased by 3c a gallon. "

- I should like to be associated with this motion of condolence to the widow and family of the late  Sir Wilfrid  Kent Hughes. He was a truly great man. Mention has been made of the contributions he made as a scholar, a poet, a soldier and a parliamentarian. But, if anyone were to ask me, as one who knew him for many years, where and when he made his greatest contribution, I would certainly say that it was during the years of the depression. 
 
At that time, when events were burning themselves into the brains of those who were experiencing hardship as a result of the depression and when men were out of work, women were worried and children were hungry,  Sir Wilfrid  Kent Hughes was in charge of State relief. He was enlisting the support of the Government and voluntary organisations. All people who were imbued with the idea There but for the grace of God go I' in those days were being thrown into some type of association in order to help in whatever way they could. No effort was too great; and no request too insignificant. But through it all shone the compassion of Billy Kent Hughes, as he was known then.  His  task of administering State relief to so many people was not an easy one, but he carried it out in a manner that was typical of the man. He gave sympathy but at no time did he attempt to patronise those who were in difficulties. So although he will be known for many things, that period in our history was one that ensured for Billy Kent Hughes an abiding place in the memory of the people who worked with him and who went through those difficult years. 
 
He was a great family man. Possibly his appreciation of the problems of other people, which was gained so early in his life, helped him during his years as a prisoner of war and enabled him, with that determination that marked everything that he did, to endure and to return to the family whom he loved and who loved him so much. I have many memories of  Sir Wilfrid  Kent Hughes and therefore I would like to support the motion. "

I suppose that there is no policy area in which the Prime Minister's credibility has suffered more than in the field of health insurance. The man who in 1975 pledged to the nation that Medibank would be retained has been shown, as in so many other areas, to be untruthful. In the field of health insurance the people of Australia are now in a worse situation than they were in prior to the establishment by Medibank by the Labor Government. Today  Mr and Mrs Citizen  are faced with a bewildering array of insurance options- an array which resembles a tin of worms or a bag of eels- and all this in a climate of fear perpetuated by health insurance organisations in their advertising for clients. Thousands of people undoubtedly are paying their $10 a week, or whatever, for cover which many of them will never use and that payment is not even tax deductible as it was prior to the establishment of Medibank. Perhaps one of the best exposures of the system which this Government has created was published recently in a Melbourne daily newspaper. It was penned by a citizen of rural Victoria. It is a poem entitled Rhyme but no reason' and reads as follows: "

- I was happy to receive from Professor Karmel the full text of the speech that he proposed to deliver. So I have been able to see the speech in its entirety, quite apart from the newspaper reports of it. Some of the newspaper headlines were a little poetic in their interpretations. Professor Karmel is a universally well regarded educator. He has been part of the discussions and consultations that my Department and I have had in relation to the whole question of transition from school to work. He was present at and participated in the recent discussions of the Australian Education Council in which there was a common agreement amongst all States and the Commonwealth on various matters pertaining to juvenile unemployment. 
 
It is not surprising that so much of what Professor Karmel has spoken and written about is also part of the evolutionary process of the policies of the State and Federal governments. For example, the question of basic skills was also reflected on by Professor Williams in his report. The Australian Education Council has undertaken to set up certain methods of testing skills at regular intervals and to do national sampling in order to put pressure upon the upgrading of skills. The experience of various youth employment schemes has shown the need for us to do very special things. The States will be looking back into the high schools to detect students at risk. The States will be assisted by the Commonwealth in these endeavours. We will be trying to improve the skills and the attitudes of young people and their adequacy in these areas. A wide range of transition programs from school to work is already being developed and further programs are under contemplation. 
 

             Senator Young mentioned high pay rates. It is true that employers, given the choice of a mature person or a juvenile, for a variety of reasons tend to choose the mature person. Whether that is due to mature delivery of work or to inequities in the pay rates, I cannot say. But an enormous amount of work is being done on this matter now. It was the kernel of the Williams Committee report. I am hopeful that in the weeks ahead we will be able to make progressive announcements on further work that we are doing. "

No poems can please for long or live that are written by water drinkers. 
 
In relation to  Senator Georges'  contribution to the debate, I just wondered whether he was trying to prove some point about the need for cooperation not only in relation to the question of drinking wine or water but also a number of other things. 
 
I would like to raise briefly my concern over reports such as this. When one reads the report it is hard to take exception with the careful details contained in it. But when one only reads a Press report indicating that a Senate committee has taken upon itself to say whether it is fair or not fair for the Wine Promotion Board to be trying to promote the consumption of wine and what the standards ought to be, I think that the Press is rather taking upon itself the role of my brother's keeper. The consumption of alcohol and its effects in the community, which are well known, concerns me, as does the consumption of tobacco and nicotine and all the other things which society does because it wants to do them. Society usually knows the risks that are involved and, notwithstanding that knowledge, makes a conscious judgment that it will do them. Driving cars and killing ourselves at an incredible rate is but one example. "

- The Labor Opposition has just demonstrated why, on rare occasions, we sit after the time at which the adjournment motion is usually proposed. For the last hour and a quarter the Opposition has taken up time that could have been spent in very useful debate, for instance, on the Human Rights Commission Bill and other measures. Opposition supporters have been talking absolute nonsense and indulging in a kind of ritualistic, tribal histrionics. I make it perfectly clear that in recent years the sessions of this Senate have been concluded in an orderly, tidy manner with all business completed, without the need to bring down the guillotine. I may say that that has been absolutely contrary to the history of the Whitlam Labor Government. The then Leader of the Government in the Senate,  Senator Murphy,  in order to get the Senate up, gagged through 43 Bills in one go. Yet we find these people, with crocodile tears streaming from their eyes, telling us how wicked it is to use the gag. 
 

           Senator Chaney has been able to show honourable senators that, as regards General Business, they have had a far better run under this Government than they had under the former Labor Government. So do not let us pretend. The Party that gags, guillotines and railroads Bills through is the one whose supporters now sit on the Opposition benches. The Party that in recent years has ordered the passage of Bills through this Senate by discussion- and will continue to do so- is that which forms the Government of the day. By proceeding in a tidy fashion, it has avoided completely the use of the guillotine at the end of sessions. It has indeed, given honourable senators a fair go, so the suggestion that General Business was never set aside by Labor has been blown apart by 
 

           Senator Chipp had something to say about whether he would be here after 10.30 p.m. Every honourable senator may look to his own conscience as to whether he will be here at any time, whether it be before or after 10.30 p.m. That will be a matter for the people to judge in the future. I make no further comment about that, but it is nonsense to say that an honourable senator can make a sound judgment at 10 o'clock but cannot make it at five minutes to eleven at night. That could be taken basically as a reason for changing the hours of the Senate completely. All that is being asked is that the procedures of the past be legalised; that we do what has been done before so that it will not be necessary to use the guillotine as it was used by the former Labor Government, or to ram Bills through. We will give all honourable senators a fair go. If Opposition supporters wish it I will bring down in the Senate proof of the fair go that the Opposition has had in discussing its urgency motions, its matters of public importance, of the fair go that it has been given at Question Time and of all of the other ways in which the Government has sought to make this a workable Senate. 
 
As the Leader of the Government in the Senate, I have a vested interest in ensuring that all honourable senators receive a fair go. I assure them that they will. It has been suggested that there is something wrong; that the debate on the Budget was not sufficiently lengthy. Do Labor supporters want me to cite the speakers' lists when the Budget was being discussed under a Labor Government and compare them with the speakers ' list on this occasion, when in fact a very lengthy debate has been conducted? Do Labor supporters want details of the number of times when the former Labor Government brought down the guillotine? Their claims are nonsense. I do not wish to prolong the debate because an hour and a quarter of valuable time has already been wasted, but if the Australian Labor Party wastes the time of the Senate it is only fair to the taxpayer that a time adjustment should be made in the period after the adjournment motion is formally proposed. I believe that the taxpayer would consider that to be poetic justice. It is for all honourable senators to examine their own conscience. I commend the motion to the House. "

- I am not the greatest reciter of poetry, my boy,' but let me say that at the moment we have a Prime Minister who is sticking right to that last verse: "
398,8/3/79,31,1,3,SENATE,658,0,8/3/79,Senator BUTTON,4F4,Second Reading,bill,Victoria,,,0,0,"
 
-The Opposition does not oppose this Bill, although we are not entirely happy about the generosity of its provisions. The purpose of the Bill was stated by the Minister for Education  (Senator Carrick)  in his second reading speech in the following terms: 
 
The purpose of this Bill is to enable the proceeds from commercialisation of activities conducted under the National Fitness Act to be paid into the National Fitness Trust Fund. In particular, the Bill will enable proceeds from the commercialisation of the national' Life. Be in it 'program to be paid into that Fund. 
 
The important point about that statement which was supported by the Minister for Home Affairs  (Mr Ellicott)  in his second reading speech in the House of Representatives is that it does involve the commercialisation of the 'Life. Be in it' campaign and, in a sense, the commercialisation of national fitness in this country. In the House of Representatives the Minister for Home Affairs stated: 
 
The 'Life. Be in it' philosophy is to encourage Australians to become more active. The campaign stresses the enjoyment and benefit to be gained from recreation. The long term objectives of the campaign are to change Australia's attitudes and behaviour towards sport, fitness and recreation. 
 
The present Bill seeks to grant $600,000 a year over three years  to the  National Fitness Trust Fund to promote the 'Life. Be in it' campaign. This totals $1.8m for the promotion of national fitness in Australia. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. It supports the Government's program; but it has to say, reluctantly, that the program does not go far enough. The 'Life. Be in it' campaign is a brilliant concept in terms of design and commercial advertising. But the art is the art of the designer and not the art of the sportsman. It is brilliant, I suppose, in that it represents a notion which is attractive to everybody, a notion of full participation in all of life's pleasures, particularly the physical pleasures. To that extent it can be contrasted with another view of life which, I suppose, is brilliantly summarised by Dorothy Parker in her little poem 
 
Razors pain you; Rivers are damp; Acids stain you; And drugs cause cramp. Guns  aren  't lawful; Nooses give; Gas smells awful; You might as well live. 
 
That is a very different philosophy of the reasons for being alive. "

- It is very sombre, yes, but it is a philosophy which has its attractions, as the honourable senator must admit. But it is very sombre compared with the notion put forward in the 'Life. Be in it' campaign. 
 
We in Australia have now reached the point where governments have to spend admittedly limited funds on programs such as 'Life. Be in it' as a sort of artificial commercial stimulus to what ought to be a national activity- what in years gone by was characterised in the popular song  Doin' What Comes Natur'lly.  I think when we are confronted with this situation of having to spend money on a commercial program to encourage people into these sorts of activities, it is perhaps time for a nostalgic sigh for the glories of the years gone by, time to ponder on the decline in the rugged society of homo Australis and time to examine some of the assumptions upon which our society operates. It is my purpose in this debate to try to make some contribution about those important issues. No one in the Senate, I would imagine, would argue about the importance of physical fitness. Norman Douglas in his great poem 
 
There is a beauty of fitness which no art can enhance. 
 
Perhaps I could translate that noble message into commercial terms for the benefit of Government senators. Some of the less honourable ones would probably remember the famous student song called  Lillian,  which, as I recall, begins: 
 
Lil was a girl, Lil was a beauty She lived in a house of  ill-reputee  She drank too deep of the demon rum She smoked hashish and op-i-um "
400,8/3/79,31,1,3,SENATE,659,0,8/3/79,Senator BUTTON,4F4,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"
 
- It does a bit. Perhaps the honourable senator could commend it to Qantas. He is pretty good on Qantas advertisements. The last two lines of that famous song  Lillian  are: 
 
The moral of the tale of Lil and her sins Whatever your line of business, fitness wins. 
 
I mention that for the benefit of Government senators, obsessed as they are with a line of business, and I would make the comment in passing that one suspects that the considerable decline in fitness is perhaps some explanation of the low level of economic and commerical activity in Australia at the moment. But of course there are other more important things associated with fitness with which I want to deal. These things are important not only for commercial reasons but also because of their relationship to national pride, national ethos, and things of that nature. 
 
About 60 years ago during one of the more glorious periods in Australia's history, John Masefield had something to say about the Australian man when he described the Anzac Corps which landed at Gallipoli in this way: 
 
They were, however, the finest body of young men ever brought together in modern times. For physical beauty and nobility of bearing they surpassed any men I have ever seen; They walked and looked like the kings in old poems and reminded me of the line in Shakespeare: 
 
Baited like eagles having lately bathed '. 
 
That, of course, became part of the great Australian tradition, part of the Australian man's perception of himself and it probably remained so as an important ingredient in the Australian national ethos and identity right up until the Second World War. "

-I move: 
 
That the Senate believes that the unjustly imprisoned members and affiliates of the Soviet Helsinki group should be granted their freedom and allowed to pursue their lawful activities on behalf of basic human rights without further harassment, and that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs should express at every suitable opportunity and in the strongest terms the opposition of Australia to the imprisonment of members of the Helsinki group. 
 
The names of Anotoly Schaharansky, Alexander Ginsburg and Yuri Orlov were household names throughout the world barely eight months ago. Are these names now forgotten in those homes? Though this motion was put down in the Senate on 24 May 1 978 after Orlov had received his sentence and before Shcharansky and Ginsburg had received theirs, nevertheless it is as relevant today as it was then- even more so. I remind the Senate of the significance both to human rights within the Soviet Union and to world peace and prosperity of this particular issue and these particular men. 
 
Anatoly Shcharansky who is now 31, a mathematician and computer engineer, had been unemployed since 1973, blackballed by the Soviet authorities from obtaining a job. Why? Because he had made an application to go to Israel and that application was turned down. With an excellent command of English, Shcharansky had been a one-man public relations organisation for the dissidents, arranging interviews for Western correspondents with the Helsinki monitors and often interpreting for Andre Sakharov, the dissident Nobel prize winning physicist. Shcharansky was also the link between Soviet Jews who wanted to leave the country and human rights advocates who wanted to reform their society. The Soviet Government's case against Shcharansky was unusual because it involved alleged United States subversion and espionage and because it led to  President  Carter's flat denial that Shcharansky had ever worked for US Intelligence. On 14 July 1978 Shcharansky was sentenced to 13 years imprisonment. Alexander Ginsburg, who is now 42 years of age, published an underground poetry journal in the late 1 950s. In 1978 he was arrested and sentenced to a labour camp for two years on charges of forging a certificate to take an examination for a friend. 
 
Later he served five years in a camp for 'AntiSoviet agitation and propaganda activities'. 
 
Until his third arrest in 1977, amongst a group of 20 other arrests, he administered a fund set up by exiled author Alexander Solzhenitsyn for royalties in Western countries from his book the  Gulag Archipelago  a study of the Stalinist labour camp system. Ginsburg said that the aim of the fund was to help political prisoners and their families.  His  arrest marked the opening Soviet shot at the Helsinki monitors. On 13 July last year, barely eight months ago, Ginsburg was sentenced to eight years of hard labour. Yuri Orlov, who is now 54 years of age, was the victim of the first major political prosecution after the Helsinki accords.  His  four-day trial, which ended only six days before I gave notice of this motion in the Senate- that is to say, it ended on 1 8 May 1978- brought him a sentence of seven years of hard labour and five years of internal exile for Anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'.

While I was in Sydney, two years ago, I saw a wreath placed on the Cenotaph in Martin-place. It bore a large card with the inscription ""Because you would not think, we had to die "". Those words are taken from a poem written during the lastwar. Because there has been no constructive thinking since, millions more will have to die. There is no doubt whatever in my mind , that there is a power which can sway governments to its will. I believe that there is no such thing as democracy. We were told by the great Abraham Lincoln that ""Democracy is government of the people, by the people, for the people "". It is not logical to contend that the people,' who are said to govern, get whattheywant. Do the people want wars?' They do not; yet we have them. Dothey want poverty, malnutrition, slums? No; yet we have all of those dreadful things, proving conclusively that. we have not democracy as we visualizeit, and that, the people are not governing: George Bernard Shaw was once asked to define political economy, or the art of government; and he said: ""Political economy is the art of spendingthe national income in such a way as will bring happiness and prosperity to the greatest number of people.""

- I am glad to find  Senator Ormonde  in such strong disagreement with me, because 
 
To turn from the canting humbug, dishonesty and hypocrisy of the Perth document to the proposals of the present Administration, as enshrined in this Budget, is to forsake an area of Gilbert and Sullivan for an area of sanity, justice and reasoned optimism. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, during his speech on the Budget, and at intervals thereafter, seemed possessed of a fixation. He displayed a nervous anxiety to get rid of me - I think he meant politically - and to that I take no exception. However, it seems to have really got him down. I thought that his ire was probably not raised by my politics, and so I bethought myself of the real reason for his continuing irritability. It is quite true, as  Senator Kennelly  suggested, that as I am the third member of a Senate team my place must be the one in jeopardy. I do not think that my defeat is likely, as he prophesied, but I am no autocrat and I concede the possibility. I tell him - I am sorry that he is not present to hear me now - that he has made his second-last speech on a budget in this chamber. I remind him that whatever difficulties I face are just molehills compared with the mountains which he must confront in holding his pre-selection. 
 
No longer is he Warwick the Kingmaker. He cannot frighten or intimidate people around the Trades Hall these days. He is not running Tammany Hall any longer. The Lygon-street Kremlin is gunning for him, not because of any genuine right-wing activities, but simply because it is felt that his replacement is due. I understand that the odds against him are quoted in Melbourne at four to one. That is why he has to show how militant he is, by abusing me and other senators on this side of the chamber. The darling of the Victorian State Labour executive in this Parliament is, of course,  Dr. Cairns.  The  Deputy  Leader's odds would lengthen to about thirtythrees if the State executive suspected that he was responsible for 
 
I appreciate this, and I am inclined to be tolerant and understanding of the Deputy Leader's difficulties, because he has further worries. Big brother Chamberlain has announced that he will be entering the Senate at the next election, so if the Deputy Leader should manage to fluke preselection he would face the certain loss of his deputy leadership to big brother. One of the English poets put it in this way. "

Doth walk in fear and dread. 
 
Because he knows, a frightful fiend 
 
Doth close behind him tread. 
 
I do not suggest for one minute that  Mr. Chamberlain  is loathsome. I merely take the words intact from the old English poem. They summarize in four lines the apprehension which the  Deputy  Leader feels and which, for some reason or another, he thinks he must take out on me. The final worry perhaps this is the real irony of the matter is that if he does manage to displace me from the Senate he will put in some one of whom he is even more afraid, former senator McManus. 
 
All in all, in a spirit of Christian charity, I should attempt and I know honorable senators here and opposite will attempt to forgive the  Deputy  Leader his petulance and irritability.  1  know that at heart he is a kind man, but his cup of woe is enough to unnerve a far stronger character than he is. Since we have recited his difficulties, we should attempt to forgive him in that spirit in which Christian politicians approach their difficulties. He is really an object of pity rather than of hostile criticism. I just tell him that the hostile criticism which I could let him have if I thought be was strong enough to take it, I shall put on one side. I must apologize for detaining the Senate for so long on the peccadilloes and woes of my friend the Deputy Leader. What I have said was merely intended as a signal that if he wants to start it again, as he did this time, I am perfectly willing and able to finish it, and I will do it. 
 
I leave minor matters to come to the most important matters facing any national administration. I congratulate the Government on the attention that it is paying in the Budget to expanding defence services. In particular do I approve of the close and vital link between Australia and the United States of America for mutual defence. I believe that the Anzus treaty will be the finest monument to the Menzies Administration that any government of this country has ever won. The new naval communication base, the Anzus treaty, and Seato are clear indications to our ally that we mean what we say and that we are a trustworthy ally. We were the first to fly side by side with Americans in Korea, to fight with them on land, and to join their bombarding squadrons at sea. We have helped, too, in Viet Nam and in Thailand. When we have been called upon, although we are small, we have not been found wanting. The United States has almost unlimited material power, but in the councils of the nations it needs moral support, and that is precisely what this nation, under this Administration, is giving to the Americans. We have given them vital moral and material assistance in their campaign to stem the march of Communist aggression. We have demonstrated to the United States that when the chips are down Australia will stand up and be counted. "

At Loxton in some areas it was impossible to cultivate the land because of the saline content. The Government is now considering pumping water from the river Murray for many miles so that as it percolates back it will remove the saline and make irrigation and cultivation possible. A problem in these developments is the cost, but large areas along the river Murray could be cultivated with the use of water and trace elements. Provided markets can be found for the produce there are unlimited possibilities in the area along both sides of the Murray in South Australia. With the possibility of a change of government in South Australia, we can expect great progress. The fact that the State Government has governed with such a slender majority in the past has brought great benefits. We can see a great future for South Australia under a stable government if all the essential requirements are met. The difficulties in South Australia were realized by the poet Henry Lawson who described the situation very accurately when he wrote ""The Storm that is to Come "". The poet wrote - "

In those words, the poet described the threat that existed in South Australia. As a South Australian, one must appreciate the bill before the Senate and the work of the government departments that has made this legislation possible.I mentioned the need for a national review of the problem of shortage of water. One objective of such a review would be to ascertain whether greater use could be made of available water. When I visited Woomera I was impressed to find that they reticulate firstgrade water there and distribute by cartage secondgrade water for irrigation. Much of the water that we pump at considerable cost from the river Murray to metropolitan areas in South Australia is used for industrial purposes for washing bottles, for instance. Once it is used it is discharged into the -sea. A great volume of water is used in power plants. In some places this kind of wasteful use is. avoided by building power plants close to the sea and using salt water to generate power and cool the engines. At present much cooling of engines is done with fresh water, which is then wasted. I wonder whether the experts could find a way of using our available fresh water to better allround advantage. "

.- My good friend and colleague,  Senator Anderson,  favours a return to the daylight saving scheme which caused so much violent controversy during both world wars. I do not agree with the honorable senator's contentions, but nevertheless I must compliment him on his quite eloquent approach to this subject through the magnificent avenues of the solar system. I enjoyed very much indeed what he had to say in this respect, because we do not often hear in the Senate speeches which are interlaced with such good English and such fine thoughts. 
 
The Daylight Saving Bill 1916 was introduced under the war-time powers of the Commonwealth and was entituled "" A bill to promote the earlier use of daylight in certain months yearly "". It became operative on 1st January, 1917. The Parliament and the people of Australia reacted very enthusiastically to the legislation. The arguments in its favour found ready acceptance. They included the greater use of the hours of daylight and the opportunity to save coal, which was in short supply during the war. 
 
The idea of daylight saving was novel to Australian politics, although it was by no means an original Australian conception.  Senator Anderson  has reminded us that William Willett, an Englishman, was  a  pioneer in the field of daylight saving. In 1907 he published a pamphlet entitled "" The Waste of Daylight "". He said- 
 
While  daylight  surrounds us, cheerfulness reigns, anxieties press less heavily, and courage is bred for the struggle of life. 
 
Naturally enough, with this poetic approach Willett's brochure attracted many supporters throughout Europe. In 1916, under conditions of war, Willett's philosophy was warmly received by political leaders in most of the countries engaged in the great struggle. The early enthusiasm in this country, however, went quickly when daylight saving was tested in operation by the realities and needs of primary and secondary industries. So much was this so that the act was repealed in August, 1917. The bill for its repeal was carried in the Senate by 22 votes to four. It is hardly necessary to remind honorable senators that at that time the Senate comprised only 30 members. "

I would also like to speak on another section of the Budget in which mention is made of special work in connection with water. In this vast and sunburnt country, as the poet has described it, water must always be of major importance. Anyone who has livedin the country, as I have, and has grown up in areas which are very dry, has been taught from childhood the necessity of saving water. We have learned to look upon it as a veritable lifestream. As I go through the Treasurer's Budget Speech I am very pleased to see the assistance that is to be given to Western Australia for the extension of its Comprehensive Water Supply Scheme, and further, that the Government will assist the States in an accelerated programme of investigation of underground water resources.

. - The Opposition has decided not to oppose the proposition of the Government. This has been indicated by the Leader of the Opposition  (Senator McKenna).  I am sure that some of the persons who have addressed themselves to this question have a great love for the Senate, but listening to what has been said I am reminded of the words of the poet who said that each man kills the thing he loves. A serious constitutional question is at issue. There is no doubt, when one considers the Constitution, that the true criterion is as stated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate 
 
It is not the policy of the Australian Labour Parly to leave the Senate in existence and, by some back-door methods, to deny it its constitutional rights, and to attempt to subvert the Constitution. The policy of the Australian Labour Party is that if the Senate is to be abolished it should be abolished by the people as a result of a referendum. There will be no endeavour to do something indirectly which the party is not prepared to do directly. 
 
If the criterion of the Government is applied, as the Minister said it will be, fairly and reasonably and without any attempt to undo what is provided in the Constitution, what is the real position? There should be a clear distinction between the ordinary annual services of the Government and other matters. Each one of the four main words in the criterion stated by the Minister is important. I refer to the words "" ordinary "", "" annual "", "" services "" and "" Government "". When one considers some of the legislation which hitherto has been passed through this Parliament one can share the criticism which has been expressed. I should like to add some other criticisms. It has been said that the opinion of the Solicitor-General was so elastic that nothing could seem to be outside the criterion of the ordinary annual services, although I have noticed that references have been made to what was ordinary and what was extraordinary. That is not the criterion. The criterion is: What are the ordinary annual services of the Government? 
 
One would think at first sight that, if the Senate were ever faced with a bill to make provision, interim or otherwise, for the appropriation of moneys out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the Government, and one found provision in that bill for departments and services, one would be extremely surprised to find that included in what were apparently departments of the Government was the Parliament of this Commonwealth.

.- -by leave - The Opposition found a great deal of interest in the announcement that was made by the new Leader of the Government in this chamber. I begin on behalf of the Opposition by offering congratulations to  Senator Paltridge  upon his promotion to the important office of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. J congratulate, too, the new  Deputy  Leader, 
 
He has played a very major part in keeping up the Government's wicket, down fourteen long, weary years. We concede that to him. Whilst I express admiration of that performance, I must confess that I cannot find it in my heart to forgive him for it. We of the Opposition saw him as a very competent, hardworking and effective Minister and a very effective Leader of the Government in this chamber.  His  record has been put before the Senate by the new Leader of the Government in the Senate and I do not propose to traverse the ground he has covered. In  Senator Sir William  Spooner I found a man such as was described by the poet as: "" The foe that comes with fearless eyes "", and I respected him as such. 
 
In the hundreds of matters, important and unimportant, that had to be discussed and arranged between the Leader of the Government in this place and the Leader of the Opposition, all those arrangements, down all the years, were made by word of mouth. I do not recall an instance in which we found it necessary to commit them to writing. I want to say quite publicly, in this place, that throughout every day of the past fourteen years I found that  Senator Sir William  Spooner's word was his bond. We had no difficulty on that ground.

-  I have before me a report ' that appeared in the "" South Pacific Post "" of 17th July 1964, and I know that a certain industrial organisation took the matter up with the Administrator of Papua and New Guinea. I know that the Administrator replied to that organisation and has admitted that certain action had been taken and that the case had caused great concern. This sort of conduct on the part of Administration officials is certainly not good for the people in this area. The "" South Pacific Post "" had this to say about this sort of action in an editorial published on Friday, 17th July - 
 
are we encouraging among the people an awareness of the need to report, to discuss, to debate, to disseminate freely matters of public' moment? 
 
This is only one of many matters which causes me concern about the attitude of the Administration towards the indigenous people. My colleague  Senator Dittmer  has' referred to the Public Service case. I agree' with his statement -that sooner or later this will cause considerable industrial unrest as the Territory moves towards independence, especially when the education programme now being undertaken comes to fruition. 
 
I remind honorable senators of the very poor handling of the recent mutiny by police constables. The Administration seems to think that indigenous members of the constabulary were concerned only about the late supply of uniforms. I am sure I will be supported by my colleagues on this side of the chamber and by  Senator Cormack,  who was a member of the delegation which visited Papua and New Guinea in April, when 1 say that it was obvious on the occasion of our visit that members of the constabulary were concerned not so much about uniforms as about poor pay and the poor conditions under which they were employed. At one time these members of the constabulary were officered by Australians who were under the control of the Department of Native Affairs. Those officers lived and worked with the members of the police force and shared their problems and dangers. Suddenly it was decided to remove control of members of the constabulary from the Department of Native Affairs and to set up a police department similar to the Police Departments in the various States. This reshuffle, which was made without any discussion with members of the constabulary, caused great concern. As a matter of fact, 
 
 All I am saying is that the Administration must learn to treat these people as people. In the days of the great depression Henry Lawson wrote a poem which was entitled "".Wait Here for Second Class"". Now in 1964 officials of the Administration, parti- cularly in and around Port Moresby, must realise that there . are no second class citizens in Papua and New Guinea. I repeat that I hope that now the House of Assembly, the membership of which includes indigenous representatives, is functioning it will keep a close eye on the rights of the people of the Territory. For far too long they have been regarded as second class citizens by certain officers of the Administration. 
 
I wish now to refer to one or two other matters related to Division No. 896 - Miscellaneous Services - and to the grant of over £28 million to the Administration. On my trip to New Guinea it was obvious to me that one of the greatest problems in the economic and political development of the Territory is that of communications. The roads into the Eastern Highlands and to the seaboard towns of Lae and Madang are in a comparatively poor state. Obviously a great deal of expenditure and a great deal of work is required on road making generally. I ask the Minister to inform the Committee whether any plans have been formed to train indigenous personnel in Papua and New Guinea as engineers. The time is fast approaching when these people, in conjuction with Europeans, must be given responsibility in the administration of their own affairs. Roads are of paramount importance in the economy of New Guinea. I should like to know' what road making facilities are available in Papua and New Guinea. Are stone crushing plants available so that roads with reasonable surfaces may be laid? 
 
Air communications play a most important part in the development of New Guinea. The rich areas of the Eastern Highlands are at this stage comparatively untapped. Tea growing is either taking place or is about to take place. Coffee is grown and a passionfruit pulping plant has been build at Goroka. Whilst the roads are poor, the transport of products of the Eastern Highlands must be undertaken by air to the seaboard towns. I suggest that the Administration should consider embarking upon the selection of members of the indigenous population to be trained, in the not too distant future, as air pilots and navigators. What is the situation in regard to decimal currency? This is another problem that must soon be faced by the Administration. For the most part, the people of Papua and New 
 
Guinea recognise the shilling as a form of currency. With the change over to take place- "

Our policy is that matters of this kind should be referred to the conciliation and arbitration courts. That is the view that has been outlined to-day. In rising to sp:ak on this subject, unless one is prepared to support it, he is apt to stick his neck out - to put it crudely - and bring down on his head the wrath of a certain section of the female community.

I think it was  Senator Anderson  who said that some areas benefit from floods because the receding waters leave behind them very valuable soil, but I remind the Senate that while floods do deposit valuable silt on some areas they denude other areas of their good soil. In some years, floods are responsible for carrying thousands upon thousands of tons of good fertile soil into . the sea. This is one of the things that flood mitigation can help to prevent. Soil conservation, for instance, can be related to flood mitigation in this way, and we have seen great strides made in the prevention of soil erosion during the past few years. The prevention of soil erosion anywhere will help considerably in flood mitigation work because by preventing soil erosion much can be done to hold the waters in their original channels. One honorable senator quoted some poetry this afternoon. It reminded me of the poem about the drover who was returning home. It went something like this - "

-  I do not wish or propose to go into the underlying reasons which may motivate Indonesia. What concerns me is that we live in a world which could avoid fighting wars if people would avoid doing these things. In the clearest terms one country is prepared to use armed mcn to attempt to impose its will upon another country outside the borders of the first country. This has nothing to do with Communism, but is the old story of power politics. Examples of this have been multiplied in the last few months. Once this situation arises, once there is evidence of a willingness to do this kind of thing, I believe that a country faced as Australia is faced must say: ""We cannot, apart altogether from questions of ideology, stand by and permit the use of armed forces by one country on another country if there is anything we can do to prevent it "". Apart from the fact that this sort of thing escalates into the wars which we seek to avoid, the situation is comparable to that described by John Donne, the poet, when he wrote - 
 
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; lt tolls for thee. 
 
Once this situation is allowed to occur without question, this country, or some other small country, may be the next one into which armed men will come. This is happening very close to us now. 
 
For these reasons, which have become more and more evident in recent times, it seems to me that we must do something to meet, not an immediate situation, but a situation which recent events indicate is now more likely to arrive quickly. In order to meet the situation, we must have the capacity to fulfil our obligations and to expand our Army if the need should ever arise. The Government thinks that its proposals represent the proper course to take for the safety of all Australians. If the Opposition thinks that these measures are not required and that we should not take this action to meet the present situation because world events do not require us to do so, let that be the issue between us and let the issue be argued as far as possible on logical lines. 
 
There is one other point I wish to make. A number of honorable senators have sought to make fun of the Minister for the Army  (Dr. Forbes)  and to show that he made a complete volte face in the various statements he made on this subject. I should like to put it on record that over the last 18 months or so the Returned Servicemen's League and other similar organisations have been advocating national service training. They have been suggesting that this training should be for a long period of time. They have suggested national service training which would involve the call-up of all the 20-year olds or the 21-year olds, whatever the age chosen might be. They have advocated something on a far wider scale than the Government is proposing. It was believed, properly in my view, that an effort of that kind, a call-up of that size, would have diffused the Regular Army to such an extent that it would not have been in a position to do the job which it should be able to do. The Government proposes a different proposition altogether. It proposes to call up a limited number of people from one age group. That is the first great difference between the proposition to which "

Common Market. The Pechiney company is one of the biggest monopolies in the Common Market area, and certainly the biggest in France, with 50 or 60 subsidiaries, but it has a lease at Gove Peninsula and is prepared to work the field there. The Commonwealth will receive a royalty on the bauxite that the company takes away from our shores, and that will be its share of the return from the bauxite. The Australian poet, C. J. Dennis, once wrote a poem entitled "" The Glugs of Gosh "", which referred to people who were selling the stones and metal in their country, not knowing their value. They continued to do that until they discovered that all their stones and metal were gone. We are allowing our bauxite to be sent to France, where it is converted into alumina and then into aluminium. 
 
We say that is good business, and that we have far more bauxite than we will ever require. That is correct. The supply is almost limitless, but Australia is not getting any great value from its bauxite. We are merely getting the price agreed upon from the company which is taking the bauxite away. No Australian labour is used in converting the bauxite into the finished product. We find that the company which is operating at Weipa is not Australian. There is very little Australian capital in it. If we follow the history of events, we can deduce that there are really two companies operating there. What are they doing? They are taking the bauxite out and are selling some of it to Japan, while the balance is going to Bell Bay. That could go on indefinitely. I said a while ago that we have a limitless supply of bauxite. 
 
But is it good business to be selling our raw resources all the time to foreign companies with very lithe interest in Australia? If we examine the activities of the shareholdings of the companies which are operating at Gove Peninsula and Weipa, we find that they are interested in the aluminium industry in other countries also. So it appears to me that they will operate the Australian bauxite fields while it suits them to do so, but if they can get a more profitable field where their other companies are operating they will cease operations in Australia and continue or revive their operations in other countries. It was recently proposed that another aluminium company would establish itself at Gladstone.  Of  course the people of Queensland, and particularly those in Gladstone, were very glad to hear this news. An export meat works operated in Gladstone for 40 or 50 years until about last November, when the works was sold and closed down by the company which had operated it for so long. "

The Leader of the Opposition, in his despair and inability to criticize the principles involved in the bill, even talked about a referendum to obtain constitutional power to control interest rates. What in the name of heaven has that to do with the problem now before the Senate? Then he complained about the wide discretion given to the secretary of the Department of Housing. Both he and I are former Ministers for Social Services, and the discretions contained in this bill are based on practical experience of the Social Services Act. The Leader of the Opposition finished up with quite a poetic touch about applicants going home to pray that their applications would be successful. He said they would not know whether they would be successful or not because of the conplexities of the measure. In reply to that I say that if we are to talk about praying, I think 40,000 young Australian couples who will get the benefit of this legislation each year will be offering up a short prayer of thanks for assistance at such a critical time in their lives.

We-  he was using the royal plural -  have noticed that the poets of France are not writing poetry. It is necessary for the maintenance of our imperial regime that the poets write poetry. The Minister for Information is directed to see that all poets in France now write poetry in praise of our imperial regime. 
 
I quote this letter only to illustrate that there always seems to exist in the minds of members of a parliament and many people outside it the idea that you can force people to do things in a climate that does not encourage them so to do.

The consultation that he did takeâthe charade of involving one of Australia's great poets and yet ignoring his adviceâwas typical of him. I recall Mr Murray publicly warned the Prime Minister about his mangling of the language, but John Howard forged ahead with his ideological and political agenda. He ignored all the attempts to assist him to rewrite his mangled mess, including offers from my colleague Gareth Evans; the combined Labor, Democrats and Greens effort; offers from the indigenous people of this country, through their representative bodies, such as ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation; and the excellent contributions of the Constitutional Convention and the people's convention."

But this preamble will be a matter of argument and dispute. It will not automatically be given a tick because, as my colleagues have said, first, the content of it is deficient in a number of ways; and, second, the English is totally uninspiring. It is extremely turgid. If you asked our schoolkids to learn the preamble that Mr Howard has produced, it would be extremely difficult because there is no rhyme or rhythm and there is no poetry in it. Kids could not learn it if they tried to. It would be a really hard effort. It would be like trying to learn your times table again and again by rote to try to remember it.

âMr Acting Deputy President, I heard what Senator Schacht had to say and, through you to Senator Schacht, I would say that the option that has come here certainly has the imprimatur of Gareth Evans through it and is far more reflective of the aspirations of Australians, far easier for Australians to take on board and much easier for young Australians to take up, recite, learn and feel good about than is the much more difficultâand unpoetic, I might sayâversion put forward by the Prime Minister. I think it is better if we look at the words and the sentiments that are involved here rather than at who put the options that are now available.
 
The Greens amendments are aimed, at this late hour, at making significant improvements to the legislation before the chamber, and this is done with a great deal of consultation with the community and with input from all around the country. I have had a very positive reac 
 tion since the release of these amendments. As I said, I put it to colleagues on this side of the house, and on the crossbench in general, to look closely at these options. The no vote is clear: the monarchists wish to retain the status quo. The yes vote is a panoply of options, but I do not believe that we have come close to the most popular set of options being put forward. I do believe that the Greens amendments will make the yes option much more amenable to the average Australian voter and will particularly redress that central defect of the Prime Minister having the power to summarily dismiss the President without reference to the parliament.
 
I recommend those amendments very strongly and I would, in the wake of those amendments being adopted in the Senate, look forward to the coming campaign. I echo Senator Payne's earlier comments that it is an exciting time. All Australians will want to be involved. It is something in which there is enormous public involvement, and we as representatives in this parliament have always had a duty to have our ears open to that public interest, excitement and positivity. I am one of those who think that this referendum is going to succeed. I think the nay-sayers are wrong.
 
I agree with Prime Minister Howard's interview last night where he said at least he did not have a viewpoint. I take it from that that he is well aware of the strong sentiment that there is for a republic in this country. I look forward to the coming campaign and to the engagement of Australians in an issue which, in the future, is going to help us to feel proud of this country with an Australian, not a foreigner, as head of state."

âSenator Boswell, I was just making the point. But to stand still and say that there can never be any change to the Constitution is ridiculous. There have been changes made to the Constitution by referendum, and I think that by and large they have worked well. There always should be a debate about it. But, as I say, individual amendments such as those moved by Senator Brown I think can be considered.
 
I would also like to say that at the private hearing of the committee on the final day I was one of those who suggested the title of the bill which was recommended by the committee. I think that is a very important and very succinct title, and I point out that it was carried unanimously by all of those presentâwhich was about three-quarters of the members of the committee. I agree that Senator Boswell was not there. Senator Abetz was not there, and I think a couple of others were not there. But Labor, Liberal and National party members who were present at that private hearing unanimously adopted the title for the bill that is in this reportâLabor, Liberal and National party members. When you read that report, that is unambiguous, Senator Boswell. Mr Causley was one of 
 those. He makes his views known generally, but he supported the title that we adopted.
 
But what we have now is the Prime Minister wanting to keep changing the title to make it more difficult. He tried to make it a way to enhance his chances of defeating the referendum. Again, I use the word: this is political `narksmanship' at its worst. I hope that he gets exposed for it by losing the referendum, as he deserves to.
 
I want to conclude on the issue of the preamble, which I presume we are going to debate here at the same time. I agree with Senator Brown that the preamble that the Prime Minister drafted is a shambles. It was laughed off the stage when it was published. Having a preamble with such words as `fashion' in it and trying to explain in 50 years time what `fashion' means or what it could mean is a joke. Putting the word `mateship' in the context of what the Prime Minister was trying to express actually does the concept of mateship damage. The Prime Minister was inarticulate. There is the idea of the Prime Minister sitting at his desk, with those big new chesterfield seats all around him, trying to write a preamble. I suppose the quill came out and the inkwell came out and he had a couple of goes. The way he went about itâby consulting hardly anybodyâhe got the result he deserved: he got laughed off centre stage.
 
Senator Brown pointed out that the draft that Gareth Evans and others put togetherâwhich was, as I understand it, overwhelmingly endorsed when it came out, not only by the Labor Party but by the Democrats, the Greens and others in the communityâis a much easier one to remember, and I agree. This is one that kids will learn at school as poetry almostâsimple, easy to remember. Mr Howard's one will never be memorable, never be learned. If they try to learn it, they will make a mess of it, because it is structurally wrong.
 
When I look to the people of America and the American Constitution, I am envious of the fact that people like Thomas Jefferson had the skill to write the form of words for the Declaration of Independence or Abraham Lincoln and the Gettysburg Address. They 
 wrote memorable words that school kids in civics lessons in America learn and remember for the rest of their lives. There is that opening phrase in the American Constitutionâ`We the people'. What a magnificent phrase that is: with one fell swoop it defines the sovereignty of all the people. Then there is the Gettysburg Address; it ends, `government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth'. Again, that is a memorable phrase that even those of us in other countries remember as summing up democracy. Can anyone suggest that when they read Mr Howard's preamble they will remember it? They will have to take a course in mind memory to try to remember the phrases in his preamble. That is why he has it wrong.
 
As a humanist, as a person who is not a supporter of any organised religion, I have a query about putting God in the preamble. I do not think in a secular state we should put in a preamble a mention of God. However, as a compromise, even though I do not think it should be there, I could live with the way Gareth Evans has put it:

âI listened in general agreement to what the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, had to say in this debate on the  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999  âthat is, it is now time to take up our identity as Australians and go forth in our history on that basis. For many centuries, Australia's history in fact had nothing to do with the English Crown or with 
 England. It has been only in the last 200-odd years that the monarch of England has also been the monarch of Australia. That history has been very productive and it is a period in which both good and bad things have happened.
 
The first Governor-General of Australia was the 7th Earl of Hopetoun. The second one was the 2nd Baron Tennyson, who was the son of Lord Tennyson, who wrote a poem that I learned at school. It was a poem written in English, the language that we speak and will continue to speak, I take it, in the future.
 
I remember that poem from my childhood days. There were some lines in it which have kept coming back to me and which seem quite apt now. While putting King Arthur on the barge to float on the lake, Sir Bedivere, the last of all King Arthur's knightsâyou will remember this, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvertâsaid, `This is awful. This is the end of the Round Table, this great symbol of justice and peace.' It is the reply that King Arthur gave him which I think is apt to quote now:

âI listened in general agreement to what the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill, had to say in this debate on the  Constitution Alteration (Establishment of Republic) 1999  âthat is, it is now time to take up our identity as Australians and go forth in our history on that basis. For many centuries, Australia's history in fact had nothing to do with the English Crown or with 
 England. It has been only in the last 200-odd years that the monarch of England has also been the monarch of Australia. That history has been very productive and it is a period in which both good and bad things have happened.

The first Governor-General of Australia was the 7th Earl of Hopetoun. The second one was the 2nd Baron Tennyson, who was the son of Lord Tennyson, who wrote a poem that I learned at school. It was a poem written in English, the language that we speak and will continue to speak, I take it, in the future.
 
I remember that poem from my childhood days. There were some lines in it which have kept coming back to me and which seem quite apt now. While putting King Arthur on the barge to float on the lake, Sir Bedivere, the last of all King Arthur's knightsâyou will remember this, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvertâsaid, `This is awful. This is the end of the Round Table, this great symbol of justice and peace.' It is the reply that King Arthur gave him which I think is apt to quote now:

âIt is a wonderful story, as Senator Lundy says. A lot of it was set against the background of Tasmania and Port Arthur. Then there is Adam Lindsay Gordon from Victoria. Those people have pictured the Australia that we have come to know and love. Dorothea Mackellar wrote those great lines: `I love a sunburnt country' and so on. They have set the symbol. Modern writers such as Patrick White, Les Murray and Bruce Dawe, who, in my view, is perhaps the greatest of Australian poets, have pictured Australia as it is. They have pictured it without feeling the necessity of introducing a monarch into that picture.
 
There has always been a move to become a separate country, and the movement towards a republic has been going on for a long time. It was in the 1880s that Louisa Lawson published the  Republican . Senator Lundy would know that. Her son Henry wrote those great poems of his, 
 
It is clear that the time has comeâperhaps it should have come earlierâfor us to take up the responsibility we have as Australians. As Senator Hill has just said, we are an amalgam of many people from many nations, and that is very important. When my forebears came here it was a country taken up predominantlyâalmost completelyâby people from the British Isles. Things have moved on since then, and it would be wrong to cling to the past. I have a great attachment to those people who came in the 19th century, as no doubt you do, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, knowing your history, but it is time not to cling to that, not to be selfish. Our predecessors welcomed people from all over the world. The place that we now dwell in is now 
 different from that of our forebears. That is the first issueâthe issue of a republic.
 
The issue of the Queen is different. On 28 April 1993 Michael Tate sent me a copy of an article which he had written entitled, `A head of state for Australia'. He made the sorts of points that Senator Faulkner was making beforeâthat the monarch of England, because of the Act of Settlement in 1701, must be a non-Catholic; it was expressed as a non-papist. The succession must go to the son, rather than the daughter, and must be in terms of age, not in terms of merit. There is the understanding that the monarch will live in England, and that is correct. They are the sorts of values, as Senator Faulkner said, which we would not acknowledge as being significant now and which in fact would be injurious. They would be corrupting influences in a country where thankfully there is not that religious dispute that there was in England in the 17th century and which is still manifest in Northern Ireland, with the marches. That is not part of the character that we as Australians would like to manifest."

I now wish to say something about the model that the republic should take. Much has been made of the fact that the Prime Minister will be able to dismiss a President, but that is the situation now. The Prime Minister can dismiss the Governor-General, just as the Governor-General can dismiss the Prime Minister. That happened in 1975. In relation to executive power, schedule 1 of the bill says:"

âI rise to speak on this motion and, in doing so, I think it would be appropriate at this time to remind the Senate of a very famous comment that Senator Peter Walsh made some time ago. He said, `If you don't know the answer to the question, don't ask it.' We can extend that with a little bit of poetic licence to say, `If you don't know what you're talking about, don't get up and talk.' I think that is very important. The proposition put before us then by Senator Murphy shows just how little he understands this issue and Oilcode."

I believe that Neville Bonner will be well remembered in Australia. He has carved out a unique place in history. His name will be remembered. From 1971 to 1983 he represented Queensland. Some would say that maybe he was a little bit before his time in what he did for the Aboriginal community, but he certainly built that bridge across the two communities. Nowhere better did we see it than at his funeral where there were white people. His adopted grandson from the white part of the family gave the most wonderful oration about the deeds of his step-grandfather. Some of his family sang, others recited poetry and one son even played the didgeridoo as we all marched out of the funeral.
 
I know it is very unusual to say that a funeral is spectacular, but this was a spectacular funeral. Both the black and white communities gave Neville a great send-off. I am sure he would have been looking down on us in the church last Friday and would have seen so many of his friends from parliament and so many of his indigenous friends, and his wife and all his family. I think there are about 130 great-grandchildren; it is a very extensive family, many of whom have been adopted as is the custom of Aboriginal people. Many of them were there; many Aboriginal people were there.
 
I extend my condolences to his family, his extended family, the Aboriginal people who were there in such great numbers, and all his friends."

âAs has been mentioned, I had the opportunity to join many of you in attending the service of thanksgiving for the life of Thomas Neville Bonner in Ipswich last Friday. Many things have been said about his life. I shared just 22 months of being a senator while he was still here and he befriended me during that timeâsomething that I valued greatly.
 
In the service there was a letter written by Dr Belinda Penglis Stebbing. His granddaughter, Roxanne Venner, I thought with great courage, was able to sing  I will sing the wondrous story , not an easy thing to do on such an occasion, I would suggest. There was the eulogy by his grandson, Mitchell, which Senator Hill referred to, and the Jagera Funeral Chant, which was played to us and introduced by his grandson, Thomas Bonner.
 
But it was the poem by Margaret Armstrong (Daylight) that I particularly related to on the day and I think a number of others at the service would have also. She had written it quite recently. With the concurrence of the Senate, I incorporate in the  Hansard  record the poem `Uncle Neville', which she had written and which she read to us and in which she refers to a number of things but, in particular, in referring to her uncle says, `My special friend'.

âSenator Reynolds has gone to the heart of the issue in respect of which this report entitled  Natural Heritage Trust Annual ReportâHelping communities helping Australia   has been produced. That is, what weight do you give economic development; what weight do you give to matters of the environment; what weight do you give to the need for people to earn a living; what weight do you give to catering for things other than economic issues, such as a great environment in which to live, a great road to drive along?
 
In this context, I think of the Great Ocean Road in my home state of Victoria, one of the most magnificent scenes to be had anywhere in the world. How would you measure dealing with that so that its appearance is `changed'âI was going to use the word `desecrated' but I do not want to load this debate. How do you treat that in a way that preserves that great, almost spiritual experience you have in driving down that road? How do you measure that against the money that economic development would bring in?
 
This question has been beautifully summed up by an article in the  Age  of 20 May 1999 by Martin Flanaganâwho came from that great state of Tasmania, which you, Mr Acting Deputy President Murphy, and Senator Calvert present in the chamber also come from. This article is about the disappearance of the Tasmanian tiger. As you would know, the last of the Tasmanian tigers was taken in the mid 1930s. A cousin of mine, John Cooney, who adornsâI use that word advisedlyâthe north-west part of Tasmania, saw it being taken out and brought into Waratah. 
 It was later shown around various shows in Tasmania and finally put into the zoo. It was the last of this animal.
 
 Earlier, in the 19th century, a bounty had been put on the head of the Thylacinus, the Tasmanian tiger, and then suddenly we were without it. In his article in the  Age  Martin Flanagan was saying that science might be able to bring the Tasmanian tiger back now. Both you, Mr Acting Deputy President, and Senator Calvert would have heard about this attempt to bring back the Tasmanian tiger through science. He says that he does not know whether it is going to come back or not. The article goes on:
 
What I do know is that when people meet a creature that is alien and strange and give it fearful names that enables them to strike it from their consciousness, what they find, with the passage of time, is what the sailor who shot the albatross in Coleridge's poem, The Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner, found. They have killed off a part of themselves that they will henceforth seek in endless and fantastic ways.
 
That is the big question we will have to answer in the environment debate that is about to come up: how much of ourselves do we destroy in not looking after the land that has been given to us through our inheritance? That is the issue that this report raises. Let us hope it makes a reasonable contribution to the future."
445,29/9/99,39,1,4,SENATE,9189,0,29/9/99,Senator COOK,RF4,In Committee,Bills,WA,ALP,Special Minister of State,0,0,"
 
âMr Chairman, through you to the minister: my reason for asking this question is that the Book Publishers Association, as I read its public comments, while acknowledging that this measure goes some way to meeting its concerns about a GST, implies that it does not go all the way. As a consequence, there will be a deleterious impact on the book publishing sector in Australia.
 
I mention this point nowâand no doubt, Minister, you will have followed the debate on the GSTâbecause one of the major points of contention was that a tax on books is a tax on knowledge; that Australia up until now has not been a nation which has taxed knowledge; and that Australia, as a country, aspires to being a knowledgeable society, one that encourages education and skilling in order to be more competitive in a global community. The government is moving now to impose a tax on books which, from a cost point of view, is a deterrent to book purchasing by making prices higher or, stated from another perspective, making books more expensive for people on lower incomes, many of whom may be students. Therefore, by imposing a tax, potential knowledge and skill and higher qualification are, if not put beyond the reach 
 of many people, certainly made more difficult for them.
 
My interest is in trying to ascertain what the so-called advantage of this tax might be. If there were some figures on what the government expects to raise by virtue of the imposition of this tax on this industry, at least we could have a healthy debate on the cost benefit of that. While many of the arguments about a tax on knowledge are, by their very nature, hard to quantify in financial or economic terms, nonetheless you can quantify the likely impact on sales and the likely impact on prices. It is also possible to identify the signal that this sends to the rest of the community. That signal goes to the point: are we interested in encouraging people to read, to learn, to acquire knowledge and information, to have their imagination challenged by fiction and poetry and to acquire cultural knowledge? When you tax books, the signal is given that: no, we are not as interested in those things as we are in acquiring some revenue. It certainly would be very interesting to look at what the amount of that revenue will be.
 
You may not be able to give me a figureâand I understand and sympathise with your dilemma; the cost benefit analysis debate is hard to engage in. But in any case I would suggest that the figure, when it is given, will not be a very impressive one; not a lot of money will be raised by this goods and services tax measure. When you compare that amount with the cost of the benefits to be applied by this bill to the industry, the net revenue gain to the coffers of the Commonwealth compared with the damage this measure will do to the industry and to the image of Australia and the message it will send to many people, it will be very much a massive minus. I think it is important that that information be in the public domain so that we can address that debate.
 
I also have to mention that, in my speech during the second reading debate, I made the point that the Democrats voted for this measure. I think I need to qualify that by saying that, in my earnest recollection, not all of the Democrats voted for it; Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Bartlett did not vote for it. 
 Nonetheless, a majority of Democrats did vote for it. Therefore, a tax on learning, a tax on knowledge was carried in the GST legislation because of that vote in this chamber. With those remarks in mind and noting, Minister, that you have had an opportunity to confer more fully with your advisers, might I ask again: are you in a position to answer the question, or do you still require further notice?"

âI move:
 
That the Senate take note of the documents.
 
These reports, from the Australian Film Commission, the Australian Film, Television and Radio School and the National Library of Australia, deal with an aspect of Australian life that we perhaps should deal with more often than we do in this place. We have today been talking about matters of industry. Yesterday we were talking about corporations. We talk about the economy of the country, which 
 of course is absolutely fundamental to the way we live. But in addition to the economy there are matters of the mind, the heart and the soul which are matters proper for parliament to deal with.
 
In these reports there is a discussion by the people writing them about the way money that has been collected from the taxpayer is used to increase the quantity and quality of the films that we produce and generally about the way we make art in this country and how we bring it to its peak. We have great artists in this country. I note, for example, that Rick Amor is going off to East Timor. He is a great Victorian, as Senator Troeth would know, and a person who has painted for a number of years and has done brilliantly at it. We have great poets like Bruce Dawe, who is now in your state, Mr Acting Deputy President Bartlett, but is a Victorian by background and by education.
 
They are just two of a great number of people who presently write, paint and tell about Australia, which helps us as Australians identify who we are, where we are going, what sort of people we are, what sort of people we would like to be, where we place our values and what our values are. That is a very significant issue, particularly now as we are soon to vote upon whether or not we want an Australian to be the head of this country. That is a question that raises these issues of identity and valuesâissues, as I say, of the heart, the mind and the soul.
 
So it is timely that we should consider the issues that are raised by the reports to which I have referred because, although I would not say they are reports that help us identify ourselves directly, they do underpin those artists and those people who help us identify where we are going, what we are and what our aspirations are. They are important questions and it is important that we as a parliament encourage those people who are able to express the things that we think ought to be expressed on behalf of us all. It is good to be able to get a number of reports, as is the situation here, which show that the community, as represented in this parliament, has matters about which it is concerned other than the plain matters of economicsâalthough 
 those matters are of course terribly importantâand that we will look at those properly.  (Time expired)
 
Question resolved in the affirmative."

âI would like to make a couple of points about the  Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1998 [1999]  . First of all, anybody with poetry in the soul would want to preserve the wildlife of the world. I think later in the year we are going to have a full discussion about biodiversity and the need to preserve the world with the magic presently in it.
 
The second point I want to make is about traditional medicine, to which a reference appears in the second reading speech. I would like to make it clear, of course, that Chinese medicineâsome call it traditional Chinese medicineâis an ancient art and a very honourable one. I would like to make clear that the exploitation of rare animals and beautiful animals is not at the heart of Chinese medi 
 cine. It can and does do a great service to humankind, without relying on those products.
 
Indeed, in Melbourne there is a move to regulate Chinese medicineâI think it might already be under regulationâby the Victorian government, and the government deserves credit for that. I put in this context the work done by Professor Chiang Lin (I know the minister, Senator Kemp, would have heard of him out Footscray way) working through the RMIT to see that regulation of medicine is properly instituted so that the good parts that come from Chinese medicineâas, indeed, with the good parts that come from any particular profession or any particular practiceâare the parts that are preserved. That needs regulation. He fought hard for the regulation and, in spite of all, has got it through. May I say, just to balance up the matter, Senator Kemp, that Senator Crowley, when she was the minister, did a lot of good work in this area.
 
They are the two points I want to make. Firstly, this bill goes to protect, as I say, the poetry of the world and, secondly, Chinese medicine should not be seen as dependent upon illegitimate products or on the killing of beautiful animals, but does have a legitimacy which, I might say, is equal to the legitimacy of Western medicine; and by marrying the two, as Professor Lin wants to do, we get a much better outcome for all people."

I put in this context the work done by Professor Chiang Lin (I know the minister, Senator Kemp, would have heard of him out Footscray way) working through the RMIT to see that regulation of medicine is properly instituted so that the good parts that come from Chinese medicineâas, indeed, with the good parts that come from any particular profession or any particular practiceâare the parts that are preserved. That needs regulation. He fought hard for the regulation and, in spite of all, has got it through. May I say, just to balance up the matter, Senator Kemp, that Senator Crowley, when she was the minister, did a lot of good work in this area.
 
They are the two points I want to make. Firstly, this bill goes to protect, as I say, the poetry of the world and, secondly, Chinese medicine should not be seen as dependent upon illegitimate products or on the killing of beautiful animals, but does have a legitimacy which, I might say, is equal to the legitimacy of Western medicine; and by marrying the two, as Professor Lin wants to do, we get a much better outcome for all people."

I would like to conclude by remembering Ric Throssell's contribution to Australia, and in particular his wonderful literary talents. Today I took some time out to revisit  My Father's Son  and came across this delightful and very poetic description of his first arrival in Canberra during World War II. I quote:
 
It didn't look much like the nerve centre of a country. Solid suburban houses laid out with architectural symmetry behind neatly uniform hedges, low white blocks of government offices planted here and there. Parliament House posed for its picture between a fringe of nonchalant lemon-scented gums . . . even the blue swell of the Brindabella Ranges on the horizon seemed to have 
 been painted as a Namatjira background to Canberra. The Molonglo trickled between poplars and willows.
 
I think this extract is a fitting tribute to a remarkable Australian who was persecuted for being suspected of holding different views and who enriched, throughout his life, the fabric of this nation with his outstanding contributions as a soldier, a diplomat and a writer. Indeed, in his final work, a literary work entitled  Jackpot  , Ric, oh so recently, has made another significant contribution to the social fabric of this country, detailing the challenges that so many Australians face with the personal tragedy associated with an addiction to gambling.
 
To Ric, someone I have known personally, albeit only so briefly, goodbye, and thank you for your contribution to this nation."

Far from least, I thank Alan Carter, who I think everybody in Parliament House knows. I think most people recognise what a fantastic personal assistant he has been for the work that we have had to do.  (Extension of time granted)  This is a poem by Adele Coombs:"

There is no feeling of that in here; it is absent. It is not only an opportunity missed but it is an opportunity denied because the Prime Minister, and sadly those few who were helping advise him, apparently do not have that connection, that passion, which I think is central to this nation's feeling of difference from the rest of the world as well as its feeling of pride in itself. And no-one could go beyond the passion of the indigenous people and their spiritual relationship with the land in measuring that passion. But you only have to look at the post-invasion poetry and song and history of this country to know how important that heart relationship we all have with the land is. To have it missing, to have it denied by the Prime Minister's preamble, even after the call of the Constitutional Convention to make sure it was specifically there, is not good enough. It is a failure to rise to the occasion. It is actually an indication that, for whatever reasons, the prime ministerial leadership in this country is not consonant with the feelings of the people of this country as a whole."

Can anyone imagine any student from our high schools, our universities, our primary schools or anywhere else going off and trying to learn his preamble by heart to be able to quote it? Not on your nelly! It is impossible to learn by heart, unless you spend hours and hours. There is no rhyme or rhythm, no `magic' to it, as Senator Brown said. There is no poetry to it. There is no memorable phraseâother than in the negative about what 
 you would not want. Fancy trying to remember the word `fashion'. I thought that he must have consulted Carla Zampatti, the spouse of the former Liberal member for North Sydney. How long will the word `fashion' last down the ages? This is his code for saying, `I do not want political correctness written into the Constitution.' And neither should political correctness be written into the Constitution: it should be a positive affirmation of how we see ourselves as people."

âOne of the problems with that is that, first of all, it needs to be bipartisan and the government's mirth at the moment and that silly interjection indicate that apparently the leader of the government in this debate was not sincere when he said that. But let me not be distracted by that. The question is about the maturity of the process itself whereby the Prime Minister took unto himself the business of drawing up the preamble. That is quite an untoward reflection on the talent and enormous capability there is of a collective of Australians to do that job better than any single person.
 
I am sure that, if the government had been in the position where, for example, Gough Whitlam, had decided to do this, it would have brought the house down over it. But here we have the Prime Minister,  John Howard, doing it, and the government is trying to defend it. But the exercise has failed. That is manifest by the division it has caused in the community and the protest there is about the failure of this preamble from the Prime Minister's office to live up to the 
 expectations of Australians that they would have a preamble which is memorable, which gives rise to pride, and which is something that Australians at school could learn and feel good about. This does not meet that high promise.
 
That being said, where do we go from here? I do not believe the Prime Minister's preamble as it stands is going to be the one put at the referendum, and changes have to be made in the next little while to ensure that there is a different option for the people of Australia. That being the case, I wonder if the government has been discussing this matter and can enlighten this committee as to what course of action is to be taken to give an alternative which is not going to be divisive but is going to be acceptable to the voters.
 
One of those alternatives, if the Prime Minister wants to stick with his proposed preamble, is to allow for an alternative or a number of alternatives to be put forward so that people have a choice. I said earlier that I have read some remarkably good proposed preambles coming from the pens of high school young people in Australia. I think a bringing together of them, for example, would come up with a succinct, poetic and uplifting preamble which many Australians would want to vote for.
 
This was not too difficult with the plebiscite over the national anthem. Three alternatives were put forward there. Not only is the talent available in Australia to come up with an alternative, but already alternatives have been penned which ought to be there so that the critics of the Prime Minister's version have a choice to make. The question is: is the government going to entertain the idea of putting a number of preambles forward so that the people can make a choice? If it is not, or while it is considering that, to what degree is the government determined that the only question to be put to the people of Australia will be the preamble as coming from the Prime Minister a week or two ago?"

âIn my contribution to the MPI debate today, I would like to draw to the attention of the Senate the ongoing plight of regional Australia and the policy issues it raises. It came home very strongly to me last 
 year when I was moving through the New England region of New South Wales, through what is called big sky country. As part of the highway that leads from Tenterfield down to Armidale, there is a major railway that runs beside the New England Highway. This was shut down about 25 years ago. For 75 kilometres there are weeds growing through the railway line and there are old broken-down stations. Perhaps to add insult to injury over the years, the New England Highway has been realigned across part of this old rail, putting us in a situation where the line could probably never be re-opened again.
 
This used to be a very vital lifeline into other areas of New South Wales that is now no longer there. The result of this type of withdrawal of services has been creating great problems across the bush for many decades. There has been a tension between the city and the bush that has existed for a long time. It is perhaps best highlighted by A.D. Hope in a poem in 1938, when he described the major cities of Australia:"

. - The thoughtful report of the committee to which we entrusted this task stimulated me to examine some of the discussions which, prior to this debate, have taken place on the subject of parliamentary allowances. I was happy to learn from a speech by  Mr. Quintin  Hogg, in the House of Commons, that my impression that parliamentary allowances were of regent origin, was quite erroneous. In May, 1946 - I quote from page 1254 of the House of Commons 
 
Moreover originally we used to pay Members of Parliament. That waa the tradition from the time when Edward I. instituted Parliament until late in the 17th century. I think the last Member of Parliament to be paid under the old regime was the poet Marvel! who represented King's Lynn about 1G85. The practice of being paid fell into desuetude as a part of the general development of corruption in our public life, whereby seats in Parliament came to be bought, sold and paid for by those who had the moans to do it. That is the historical fact. The next stage was for the Parliament of 1730 to insist upon the possession of £000 derived from land as the condition for any Member of Parliament holding his seat, which led to many disreputable evasions and which, none the loss, remained a peculiar law of our country until 1858. That being the history of the matter, I feel convinced that we have been right to return to the remuneration of Members of Parliament in lilli, and I can only feel that the time has come to examine anew, in the light of the changed circumstances, whether the figure of remuneration is right or wrong.

I want now to direct attention to a device of enlightenment described under Division 2, the Australian National University, for which has been requested a vote only £23,000 under £1,000,000. Last year, this body succeeded in spending £930,000. I, as a newcomer to the holy city, ask, "" How long, o Lord, how long ? "" How long, may I ask, are these annual votes of  £1,000,000  to be allocated for the construction of the Australian National University? If I could be informed of the commitments of the Government in administering that half-erected centre of learning I should also be obliged to the Minister. It must not be taken from these remarks that I disparage this great enterprise, but it has yet to prove itself. I think that honorable senators should be informed how many millions of pounds have gone into its construction, what additional expenditure will be required by the building plan and the extent of the commitments of the Government in maintaining individuals associated with that body.

We all know what happened to Henry Lawson. Australia let Henry Lawson starve, but after his death a bronze statue was erected to his memory. In the days when Henry Lawson lived, the people of this country knew little about soil erosion and the other factors that have caused a decline of primary production. They did not heed Henry Lawson's warning. After all, what could a mere poet know about soil erosion and national defence? But there is no such excuse for the Government to-day. The advice of experts is readily available to it. The late  Dr. Brad  field, Ion Idriess, William Hatfield, F. R. V. Timbrey, Brunsdon Fletcher, and many other authors have dealt at length with the problem of soil erosion and have suggested what they consider to be solutions to it. It is estimated that more than one-third of the land formerly under cultivation in Australia has been rendered useless by soil erosion, and this wastage is continuing at the rate of approximately 2,000,000 acres a year. Surely this problem demands our immediate attention. The Bradfield plan, the Idriess "" Boomerang"" plan, and other proposals, should be exhaustively surveyed and immediate action taken, not merely to arrest, but also to remove for all time this menace that threatens to destroy vast areas of our continent. Experts appear to agree that the fundamental cause of the problem is to be found in the interior - the so-called dead heart of Australia.In more  settled  areas, soil erosion has been caused by overstocking and, in agricultural districts, particularly in the Mallee, it has been caused by incorrect methods of farming and the removal of trees, shrubs and other herbage which provide a natural binding for the soil. However, there are many other contributory causes. Most of them no doubt are known to the experts. Water conservation, reafforestation, irrigation, reticulation and education are all part and parcel of the solution. There are many other problems that must be solved if primary production is to be increased as we hope it will be. I have pointed out before that, even if the production drive were started now, significant results could not be expected for at least two years. Therefore, the two years of procrastination by this Government means that we shall be starting four years behind scratch in our efforts to tackle the problem. 
 
I cannot find anything in the budget that will assist in any way to place our economy back on a stable basis. I cannot find anything that will encourage primary producers to co-operate in the Government's efforts to increase primary production. I cannot find anything that will assist in any way to arrest inflation. That is my experience of this so-called ""incentive"" budget. I leave the matter there. In conclusion, I repeat that primary production is declining further and further every day and will continue to decline just so long as this Government remains in office. The only solution is a change of government. I am sure that after the next general election a Labour government will be elected to grapple with these problems and to restore our economy to a stable basis. The people are waiting for an opportunity to pass judgment on the Government for its maladministration of the affairs of the nation. They are eager to record their condemnation of its failure to honour its promises to put value back into the £1, to increase the purchasing power of wages, to reduce taxation, and to lower the cost of living. They will show their resentment against the Government in no uncertain manner as soon as they are given the opportunity to do so. "

Chou En-lai, therefore, did a great job. Reports from Indonesia at the time seemed to indicate that he was the outstanding figure there. Of course, he is a highly cultured and well-educated man. When we look back at the history of red China, I think it must be admitted that no man did more than he to make victory possible for the Communists. He was the "" front "" man all the time. In the early struggles, "" Vinegar Joe "" Stillwell was there in charge of certain forces and later wrote a book entitled  The Stillwell Payers,  which was incredibly vicious in relation to Chiang Kai-shek. Stillwell called him the "" pea nut"". In his private papers there were subsequently found almost obscene poems built around Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. It is now apparent that Chou En-lai had offered Stillwell the position of commanding officer of the combined Communist and nationalist forces in China when they united. With that background, of course, Stillwell was anxious ueliminate Chiang Kai-shek, so that he could ultimately lead the combined forces There is no doubt that it was Chou En-lai who convinced General George Marshall and other leading Americans that the Communist drive in China was purely an agrarian movement, and that a? soon as the revolution was successful and the peasants were given the land. China would settle back where it wa.* before. Looking back over the years, ii can be seen that Chou En-lai was a tremendous factor in the red revolution in China. He is held in very high repute, and he enhanced his reputation at Geneva. He has further enhanced it at Bandung in the last few weeks. This man, who i# second in command in red China, is a man of great capacity, and in the council.of the world he is unlikely to be ignored. Undoubtedly he is a man of tremendous intelligence. He had a French education and speaks French and English fluently, and possibly Russian. He is a very potent force in Asia to-day, and the impression he made on delegates to the Bandung conference is something that we should note particularly. If we under-estimate the strength and intelligence of the men who oppose us, we shall be taking our first step to destruction. I have no more to say on this subject. I regard the debate as most important, and I am pleased, indeed, that it has been conducted in this chamber without the uncouthness that sometimes characterizes discussions in  the  House of Representatives.

- I do not think it is, because I do not recognise that we have any mercantile marine to assist in this way. I remember, of course, that our most magnificent contribution to the British Navy- - for the squadron which constitutes our chief means of defence - represents about £105,000 per annum. I suppose it is intended to add to that exuberant generosity by this attempt to see that every sailor on board our mail ships is a white man. That argument has no effect upon me. There is another statement of the question to which T object. I have heard both from honorable senators who support the amendment, and from those who oppose it, more or less fervent appeals to patriotism. This question is not amenable to patriotic treatment, and I might say further at this point that I do not think the difficulty will be made soluble by attempting to immerse it in poetry. Such an attempt was made last night. With regard to the cry for a "" White Australia,"" let me say that, in my opinion, there is abundant justification for it. A proper desire for the preservation of the white races in Australia is the justification for the cry ; but when the demand is extended to vessels that may carry our mails, what are honorable senators doing1! Those who wish to extend it in that direction are determined to persecute the black races. There is an enormous difference between the justifiable demand for preserving the white races on our shores and the persecution of black races at sea. That is, undoubtedly, what honorable senators who favour this amendment are supporting, and that is why it has no sympathy from me. I cannot see that the supporters of the amendment are in any way within their proper demand for a white Australia in attempting to exclude black men from mail ships. To my mind, it amounts to nothing more nor less than the persecution of the black people. "

. - After six months in office the present Labour Government has suddenly decided that unionist wharf labourers in Melbourne are not getting their fair share of work. In plain English, the Ministry has been compelled to take certain steps with the object of forcing volunteer labour off the Melbourne waterfront. Hence this regulation now under discussion. I listened to the Leader of the Government in the Senate  (Senator Daly)  yesterday afternoon with great interest, and, I must say, with a great deal of admiration for the extraordinarily fine show he put up in pleading a lamentably weak case. I think we are all familiar with the dislocation and chaos that towards the end of 1928, when the TransportWorkers Act was passed, caused enormous damage and loss to the community generally, until eventually, largely with the aid of volunteer labour, shipping services were restored. On that occasion the volunteers, who took the place of the members of theWaterside Workers Federation who would not obey an award of the Arbitration Court, were promised permanent preference of waterside work, a privilege which the Waterside Workers Federation had enjoyed for a long time, but apparently valued very little. Since the advent of volunteer labour during the last sixteen or eighteen months, ships have been loaded and unloaded expeditiously, and in some ports pillaging has been reduced. The Government of the day and ship-owners gave a pledge that, when the strike was over, the volunteer workers would be protected in their employment. It is the first occasion that I can remember of a promise made to volunteers who have come to the aid of the community at a time of trouble being honoured. That pledge has been faithfully kept up to now; but ever since the election of this Government there have been ominous rumblings of impending trouble for the volunteers, and threats that the present satisfactory position would be altered. It is clear that the present Ministry did notrelish any move in that direction, but as a first step it has ordered a common pick-up place for unionists and volunteers, and I submit the latter can only attend at some considerable risk to themselves. 
 
Yesterday  Senator Daly  said that police protection is unnecessary; that no more police are inquired at the pick-up place than before. On the 16th April, when I was on my way to Tasmania during the Easter recess, I saw about 2,000 people assembled in the vicinity of No. 10 and No. 11 berths on the north side of the river Yarra. It is possible that many of them were merely onlookers but in attendance there were a dozen, perhaps more, mounted troopers and about 30 or 40 foot police. That was two days after the promulgation of this regulation. It is true that there was no trouble on that occasion, but having had a good deal to do with large bodies of men in different parts of the world I am a pretty good judge, and it was obvious to me, as it would have been to any spectator, that there was in that great gathering all the elements of very serious troubleat any time. A thoughtless act could easily have brought about trouble. 
 

             Senator Daly is an optimist when he says that the idea of having a common pick-up place is to enable the two parties to come together and fraternize. In the absence of adequate police protection I can imagine a jolly good "" box on "", which at a later date some Labour poet may probably immortalize in a poem entitled, "" Howwe beat the scabs at Hogan's Flat"". Human nature being what it is there is bound to be a clash when two bodiesof men of opposing interests are brought together at a common pick-up place and there is no buffer in the shape of police. Some people are bound to get rather badly hurt. "

           Senator Sir GEORGE PEARCE.I shall take them as accurate until the Minister disproves them. On an income of £500 a year the personal exertion rate this year is £20 5s. ; the property rate last year was £18 8s., but this year it is to be £74 5s. That is, of course, in addition to State taxation. These proposals can be regarded only as class taxation to hit that section which, it is thought, does not vote Labour, and to protect those who do support the Labour party.It is a purely political move which will have a boomerang effect. While these proposals will seriously affect that section which the Government wishes to reach they will also seriously hit another class - the wage-earners. The effect will be to increase unemployment in this country to a tremendous degree. They will kill investments, and preventpeople from investing money in industry. Unemployment, which has increased from 12 per cent. to 20 per cent. during the twelve months this Government has been in office, will still further increase.

It is now proposed by regulations under the Transport Workers Act to wipe out their preference and do to them what the Federal AttorneyGeneral, in an address at Port Adelaide recently described as "" poetic justice "" - the ""justice "" part of which can well be imagined. The idea apparently of the Federal Government - incredible as it seems in a responsible government - is to penalize the men who obeyed the law in order to reward those who defied the law. The  Argus  newspaper, in a leading article on 22nd instant, under the heading of "" Preference to Lawbreakers,"" summarizes the proposed action of the Commonwealth Government in a manner that is surely expressing only the bare truth and facts of the position. The ship-owners of South Australia, having carefully considered the attitude of the Commonwealth Government, decided, so that they might keep the promises made to the volunteers, to engage them as permanent hands and this was carried into effect on 16th April, 1930, by a written contract of service with each volunteer.

- . I can understand  Senator Dunn's  mind wandering to-day; but I do not know why it should wander in the direction of Pitcairn Island. The machines which it is proposed to tax in this way are found in great numbers in the homes of the workers of this country. Many a woman left to battle for herself buys a sewing machine and takes in sewing work of various kinds. The sewing machine she buys represents the capital invested in her business. That capital the Government now proposes to tax. For the benefit of some company not yet formed we are asked to tax the households of Australia which require sewing machines. When I heard of this proposal, and recognized its extraordinary character, my mind went back to my school days when I learned ""The Song of the Shirt"". I wondered whether the Government intended to bring back those terrible times when the women of another century had to earn their living by the use of the needle. While we all hope that that day has passed for ever, it might be well if we were to recall to our mind the poem of Thomas Hood, to which I have referred - "

- The catalogues do not contain that information. While in Sydney yesterday, I  saw an English sewing machine that was purchased  by  its owner since the war for £1111s. The advertisements from which I have quoted do not state where the machines are manufactured; hut they include both English and American machines. I have just ascertained that the McWhirter machines are manufactured by the New Home Sewing Machine Company of America.. Another Queensland advertisement announces that the "" Tritonia "" sewing machine may be purchased for £11 10s. on special terms - £3 deposit with order and £1 monthly, from F. Tritton Limited, of 260 George-street, Brisbane. I turn now to advertisements relating to machines sold by David Jones Limited, Sydney. Model D. J.40 is on sale at £15 19s. cash, and Model D.J.20 at £15 cash. On many occasions during the year these machines can be secured  by  carefulbuyers at much below advertised prices. The  Daily Telegraph Pictorial,  Sydney, of 11th July, publishes an advertisement by David Jones announcing an extraordinary offer of 60 treadle machines, four drawers, drophead models', for £1211s. cash, reduced from £15. These figures prove conclusively . that prices for sewing machines quoted by the Assistant Minister and Government supporters were misleading because, as I have already stated, the retail price of £19 4s. for the Singer sewing machine includes costs of door-to-door canvassing, allowance on trade-in machines, commissions, &c. Housewives may obtain machines of excellent quality for from £10 10s. upwards. 
 
Although I was impressed by the incursion of one or two honorable senators into the realms of poetry, their efforts did not inspire me to emulate their example ; but when  Senator Dunn  was speaking I could not help recalling the parable spoken by the Great Teacher ' when he said - "" Behold, a sower went forth to sow."" In Australia there are many people engaged in the occupation of sowing, and I take this opportunity to remind the Government and its supporters that the sowers in our primary industries are contributing well over £500,000 a year in bounties to protect our secondary industries. If the Government, in continuance of its present policy, brings forward every week,, and some times two or three times a week, bills for the payment of bounties on the products of secondary industries, I am afraid that soon the sower in our primary industries will no longer be able to follow his timehonoured calling, because of the burdens imposed upon him. If to-day there arose a modern prophet, and in these times of equality of the sexes that prophet might be a woman, he or she would probably say, ""Behold, a sewer: she went forth to sew."" Housewives in all Australian homes in rural as well as urban areas are busily engaged in sewing. This essential part of their domestic duties should not be interfered with by the addition of a financial burden in the way of higher costs on the household machine. The new duty of £3 plus a bounty of £2 on each sewing machine head is altogether too much. "

There is no doubt that it is possible to manufacture a greasy substance that is very useful in making the joints limber, and rendering men acrobatic, politically or otherwise, even though they be advanced in years. There was a law-giver in New South Wales, who, at one part of his career, was perfectly solid on the question of tallow.- The people believed in that gentleman as an ardent free-trader, who, in view of the pastoral industries of New South Wales, would always be in favour of reducing the duty on tallow as much as possible. But the time came when that well known politician changed his views remarkably. I may, in passing, say that the honorable gentleman could take his hand at poetry, and was also a kind of secondhand warrior. However, the time came when this well-known supporter of . freedom for tallow changed his opinions; and yet, when he unfortunately happened to get into ""the Federal Parliament, he sought, and has since sought, to impress people with his firm belief in free-trade.

- The duty can operate only at a time when its imposition must render more difficult the lot of the settlers in Queensland and New South Wales. Where is the federal spirit of the Victorian protectionists, and of protectionists generally? It is quite likely that when this duty begins to operate many farmers, not only in Queensland and New South Wales, but in various parts of Victoria, will be not producers but consumers. Victoria may probably be unable to supply customers beyond its own borders, and the effect of the duty will be just the same in principle, if not in extent, upon the great primary producers of Victoria, as upon those of the other States. What the Victorians want is as plain as a pikestaff. In  1:902^ the year of the great drought which affected New South Wales, Queensland, and portions of Victoria, our importations of grain and pulse - maize - totalled 1,910,587 bushels. During .the same year we imported 1,037,596 bushels of oats, whilst in 1903 - when we had not recovered from the drought - we imported into Australia 2,066,365 bushels. The 'Victorians now say that in a time of national calamity settlers and others in the drought-stricken districts should not have the benefit of the competition of New Zealand in the supply of fodder. All Australia is liable to droughts. Victoria, compared with the other States, has probably suffered the least iri the average of drought, but she has certainly suffered. It is now desired to impose this duty so that when the Commonwealth is suffering, and suffering severely, from the effects of drought, those Victorians who have enjoyed a better season mav be free from the incidence of the competition of New Zealand. Ha vine travelled over districts that have been afflicted with the greatest scourge that could come upon a nation, I may be pardoned for speaking strongly. I have visited districts which in ordinary seasons produce magnificent crops of maize and wheat, and the finest grasses to be found in Australia, and have seen them devastated in such a way as to cause the spectator to realize to the very letter the poetic description given of the destruction of Sennacherib's hosts.. I have seen the plains strewn with the bones of thousands of animals that have died from drought. I am not going to say that the levying of this duty will save us from such a calamity ; but I do say that the imposition of a duty of  £1  per ton will render more difficult "" the position of our stock owners. It seems to me that the Victorian protectionists - ""prohibitionists"" is the proper word to apply to them - in this particular instance are taking up very much the attitude of a midnight prowler over a battlefield, who is bent upon emptying the pockets of the corpses.

A LiberalCountry party government has introduced a bill with which the socialist Opposition, in some respects. is in agreement. But those who believe that a farmer's produce belongs to him or to any cooperative organization to which he voluntarily consigns it have some misgivings concerning the legislation. Those misgivings are not shared by Opposition senators who uphold the worn out dogma of a dying  socialist party, which resembles those dry bones that the poet speaks of as being flung to hungry hounds. The Leader of the Opposition 
 
Having made those preliminary remarks, I wish to engage the time of the committee but briefly. This bill gives the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture the power to give directions to the Australian Wheat Board, and a statutory obligation is imposed on the board to comply with those directions. ' As  Senator Mattner  mentioned, the power of the Minister to give directions to the board extends to matters other than buying and selling. It extends .to matters such as the purchase of wheat and flour, the acceptance of wheat delivered, the selling or disposing of wheat, the gristing or arranging for the gristing of wheat, and the management and control of matters connected with the handling, storage, protection, transfer and shipment of wheat. The question that the Senate is considering is whether or not the Minister should have unqualified powers to direct the board as to how it should act in respect of any one of these matters. 
 

           Sitting suspended from 12.^5 to 2.15 p.m. 
        
 
- Before lunch, I was addressing my remarks to some observations that have been made by the Attorney-General. I had pointed out that the extent to which this amendment qualified the Minister's power of direction was confined to matters of sales, and that, as to export sales, it adopted the standard of export parity, fixed at the commencement of the year, so that the Minister would know where he stood for the remainder of the year and would not have to follow the periodical vagaries of the wheat market. I shall endeavour to put the amendment in its proper perspective. The amendment certainly is a concession to those who seek to limit ministerial control over producer boards. It is not a major concession, but it does effect a minor qualification of ministerial control. The principle of control, I suggest, would be accepted by the majority of members of this chamber only if it had the agreement of the producers in the industry. Therefore, I turn to an examination of the question as to whether or not we can be satisfied that the industry has agreed to accept this provision. We are all familiar with the despicable record that the Labour Premier of Victoria left behind him when he made this scheme a vehicle of political expediency during the last elections. Labour was not prepared to go to the country on its own responsibility and it used the Victorian Premier to spike the guns of the Australian Government in relation to wheat stabilization. We are all familiar with the trenchant rejection of those tactics by a vote of the wheat-growers. The Minister for Shipping and Transport  (Senator McLeay)  has mentioned the majority by which the wheat stabilization plan was accepted. The fact that this overwhelming majority did favour the plan might, at first glance, appear to justify the claim that the industry had accepted this ministerial direction provision. But the Minister for Repatriation "

The city is delightful and, above all, it is peaceful, except, of course, for the establishment in which we function. But it is desirable to have a contrast in life and I think that the peaceful surroundings of Canberra provide the .proper foil for this place. It is noteworthy that, down the years, and particularly since parliamentary broadcasts were introduced, tourists have been visiting the National Capital in increasing numbers. They pour into this building in thousands every week and they fill the public galleries. I understand that the inclusion of Canberra in the itinerary of tourist buses was sought, not by the proprietors of those buses, but by the travelling public. We must have regard to the fact that we are a young, developing country, and we must show our faith in its future by taking a bold and imaginative view of the development of the National Capital. It would be as well if parliamentarians, apart from the various advisory bodies that are concerned with the development of Canberra, were totake a personal and direct interestsomething that is our individualresponsibility. '  Senator McCallum  has referred to the number of bodies already concerned with the development of Canberra. I agree with him that the appointment of a parliamentary committee need not interfere with the activities of those bodies. For instance, the Public Works Committee now has before it particular problems connected with the original plans of Canberra. That committee could proceed with its work, and the parliamentary committee that I have in mind could ignore those matters until the report of the Public Works Committee had been made. I imagine that the existence of a parliamentary committee would be a powerful stimulus to all the other bodies in that field. "

âHe established the proposition that the truths that we talk about, including civil rights and the rule of law, are self-evident truths. If, on the other hand, a person ought to have choice because of the economic principles involved, then that is a different matter. In those circumstances, the truths are not as self-evident. As I think any economist would agree, there has to be some evidence about that before we go ahead with the proposition. As has been pointed out by speakers before me, there is no evidence that has been brought forward, at least in this explanatory memorandum, which would support that proposition. Senator Sherry said during the meal adjournment that if I quoted the United Kingdom and Chile, those supporting this bill would know that they were cases in which the proposal put forward here did not succeed.
 
I think it is time that explanatory memorandums were more informative about evidence. I know that we have standing committees and legislation committees which bring forward a lot of evidence, but I think it would be useful for people writing explanatory memorandums to put in such evidence as they have to support the bill that is being explained by the explanatory memorandum. I say that for two reasons. First of all, I think it would clarify in the minds of the people who prepared the explanatory memorandum, and who no doubt had a significant part to play in the preparation of the bill, the parts of the particular bill that are not supported by evidence. It would also help people who do not attend upon the legislation committee understand what the government is putting forward.
 
A lot of explanatory memorandums are like opinions or advice from consultants, not from lawyers because lawyers are very serious about the advice and opinions that they give. At times an opinion or advice is just run off to suit the reader for whom it is meant. It is not a good thing to use a language that will be attractive and not have any real thought 
 put into what is put. For example, paragraph 5.6 of the explanatory memorandum states:
 
The arrangements will increase competition and efficiency in the superannuation industry, leading to improved returns on superannuation savings and placing downward pressure on fund administration charges.
 
That flows like poetry to our mind because we have heard so often the words competition and efficiency, downward pressure, savings and improved returns. They are the sorts of phrases that resonate around the country and come no doubt from particular economic schools that people might have attended."

Over almost 100 yearsâsince we became a nationâwe have grown away from our roots, from the British cradle, which gave us so many great attributes. It is now time that we stood as Australians and as Australians alone. The statement of Sir Edward Braddon, which may have had all sorts of force on 31 January 1898, has lost its force. In that context, about 111 years agoâon 1 October 1887âthere was a poem published in the  Bulletin  by Henry Lawson. This is what he said in his second verse:"

Australia's great poet was saying at that time that there ought to be a distinction drawn between those in Australia who see themselves as Australians and those who are overseas, and that the great aspects of a nation can only be attained by people who see themselves as Australians only."

âI was just about to quote a poem by Banjo Paterson the other day when time caught me out. Just to put it in context, this is Banjo Paterson, one of the great poets in Australian history, talking about the effects of economic theory. He was saying that, when we talk about economics, we should put that in the context where it properly belongsâthat is, as a servant of a good communityâand that harsh economic theory should not be the thing that dominates the way we go about our business. Matters social, cultural and spiritual should also be taken into account. What he was talking about here was the way a runâa farm in those daysâchanged its character because of the imposition of harsh economic theory. I think it is worth quoting what he wrote: "

The same sorts of things could be said today. I say for the record that the poem appeared in the  Bulletin  on 20 December 1890, about 108 years ago. The sorts of themes that we talk about now were talked about then. It is unfortunate that the great issues are still to be resolved."

Another thing I want to talk about is that there is stress again and again in the economic policies pursued by this government and pursued not only by this government but by many people in the corporate sector which requires that expenses be cut, that employment be shed and that the interest that we should all have, according to this philosophy, is in the bottom line and nothing else. That again is not a new concept. I go this time to one of our own great authors, Banjo Paterson, Andrew Barton Paterson, who said in a poem that was published in the  Bulletin"

On the inside of the collection that he sent to me he inscribed the words:
 
Mick, didn't our school produce left-wingers? Cheers, John Forbes.
 
I read the poems and then I wrote back to him, telling him that I had spent many years after my honours degree in English literature at Sydney Universityâwhich I did along with John, although I was a year behind himâin the union movement and reading law reports, and I had not had much time for literature. I hoped that I would get some respite in the Senate and be able to return to what was a great love of my life, just as it was John's. Sadly, I have not done as much reading as I had hoped and the opportunity did not arise to meet up with John again. I am saddened by not having had the opportunity to meet him before his untimely passing.
 
I take this opportunity to put on the record not only my good fortune in having been a friend of John's, but also to recognise the contribution of somebody whose work will live on in Australian literature; someone who made a difference. I would like to quote some words from his poem  Watching the Treasurer . I will not quote the whole poem, because I do not think Paul Keating, whom I also count as a friend, would necesarily appreciate it. When describing watching Paul Keating, who was 
 then Treasurer, on television, John wrote `Paul Keating's bottom lip trembles then recovers, like the exchange rate under pressure'. John had a remarkable vision; he could see things that many of us perhaps do not often see.
 
To his parents, Leonard and Phyllis, to his brothers Michael, Chris and Greg, I say that it was a sad time when I heard about the passing of John. I extend to them my sympathies. As I said earlier, Australia and Australian literature is all the greater for having had John Forbes as one of our poets. He left his mark on our society."

Sadly, I have not done as much reading as I had hoped and the opportunity did not arise to meet up with John again. I am saddened by not having had the opportunity to meet him before his untimely passing.
 
I take this opportunity to put on the record not only my good fortune in having been a friend of John's, but also to recognise the contribution of somebody whose work will live on in Australian literature; someone who made a difference. I would like to quote some words from his poem  Watching the Treasurer . I will not quote the whole poem, because I do not think Paul Keating, whom I also count as a friend, would necesarily appreciate it. When describing watching Paul Keating, who was 
 then Treasurer, on television, John wrote `Paul Keating's bottom lip trembles then recovers, like the exchange rate under pressure'. John had a remarkable vision; he could see things that many of us perhaps do not often see.
 
To his parents, Leonard and Phyllis, to his brothers Michael, Chris and Greg, I say that it was a sad time when I heard about the passing of John. I extend to them my sympathies. As I said earlier, Australia and Australian literature is all the greater for having had John Forbes as one of our poets. He left his mark on our society.

âI rise to add to the Australian Democrat contribution on this message from the House of Representatives putting forward some amendments to the  Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 [No. 2]  . This message from the House of Representatives only appeared following the message which came from my own state of Queensland which the Queensland electorate sent to the conservative parties less than four weeks ago. That message from Queensland has obviously very much influenced the production of this message from the House of Representatives which the Senate is dealing with today.
 
As Senator Brown indicated at the start of his contribution, in comparing how we have managed to deal with this very fundamental issue that goes to the origins and fabric of our nation and society with other nations such as Canada and New Zealand, we are not only a long way behind but also going further and further backwards. That is a matter of some sadness. It is something that I addressed in my previous contributions to this bill the first and the second time around, so I will not go into that in detail this time; nonetheless, it is worth reiterating that this is a missed opportunity which we have failed to grasp. In fact, we have dropped the ball so completely that we have actually relegated ourselves to another division, which is a great tragedy for our whole nation and a particular tragedy for the indigenous people of this country.
 
Coming from Queensland and having endured the strange experience that was the Queensland state election, I saw that native title so clearly drove the minds of many of the participants in the lead-up to it. But it was interesting to see how little impact and how little role it had in the Queensland election. I think it is fair to say that to a very large extent native title, the Wik decision and the Wik legislation were not a major issue in the Queensland election. It is certainly accurate to say that it is not an issue that delivered any electoral benefits to the coalition, which is poetic justice. If you analysed the swings across the state to the different parties in 
 different areas, those parts of the state that one might say are the major native title affected seatsâthose seats that cover a large chunk of Queensland and have the vast majority of mining and pastoral leasesâdid not deliver any electoral premium for the coalition or the National Party. In fact, One Nation also had less influence and less support in those supposed native title focused seats than they did in the coastal strip of the state. That is a very significant outcome and it is an interesting statistic to point to."

A measure of this description is assured of the support of the Labour party. Those honorable senators who are aware of the attitude of the Labour party to the protection of primary industries will know that it has long been the belief of the Labour party that the labourer is worthy of his hire. The Labour Government established a system of arbitration courts and conciliation commissioners in order to guarantee a fair wage to the worker who applied his labour power to the production of commodities. We believed that the primary producer who applied his labour to the land and produced food for the people was entitled to proper protection and to an adequate reward for his effort. Before the establishment of wages boards and arbitration courts, the labourer was exploited by those who paid him only what they thought he deserved. Primary producers were in exactly the same position. They had no guarantee of a reasonable return for their crops. In the words of the old poem "" When McDougall Topped the Score "" - "

At the time of his appointment to the Canberra University College he was a lecturer at the University of Melbourne. When he came here he was appointed as Professor of Economics. Every time I look at him I wonder how in the world he became a Professor of Economics. I imagine him rather as being a scholar delving into the classics, or into poetry, literature and so forth, not as being engaged in the hard headed sphere of economics. Even greater than his influence in the classrooms has been his influence upon the student body as a whole. To him the students were definitely people. He had their interests at heart. For the last 16 years he has been a father, counsellor and friend to generations of university students who owe their success in life to the interest that he took in their welfare. I mention Professor Burton tonight because it is owing to his resignation as the Principal of the School of General Studies that this Bill has become necessary. "

.- I have listened to this debate and have watched its trend. I had not intended to speak unless the opportunity occurred Noticing that no other honorable senator rose in his place, I shall take the opportunity because I feel bound to express my views on the debate as I have heard it. 1 heard a speech from  Senator Kennelly,  full of sound and fury and, as the poet said, signifying nothing. He expressed the viewpoint of a party that has a unique outlook with regard to the integrity of the parliamentary vote, which is the subject of this debate. I remind the Senate that it was 
 
That was an explicit admission that the Federal Executive, which is an outside body and which is subject to no democratic vote whatever, controls the parliamentary vote of the party that is seeking to champion the integrity of the vote here this morning. What members of the Opposition are now facing is a dilemma in which they are dominated by the 36 faceless men. I resent these unbridled accusations of gerrymandering. As I will show by an analysis of the relevant figures, the accusations are baseless. It is completely in character for a party that will permit its parliamentary vote to be bound by an outside executive to impute gerrymandering to the Government in introducing this legislation.

I wish to refer to the administration of the Department of Immigration and to add my views to those that have already been expressed about eliminating the oath of renunciation from the naturalisation ceremony. It is my view that a large number of migrants find the requirement to take this oath to be deeply offensive, even though it is the price they have to pay to obtain Australian citizenship. The physical act of swearing by Almighty God that one will renounce allegiance to one's own country must drive deeply into one's heart. It has had that effect on me as I have seen the act taking place. I have often said that it is an imposition which this country should not expect. It is my view that many migrants who are not seeking Australian citizenship realise that the world is still unsettled and that the economies of some countries have rapidly improved over the years and are still improving. Germany is a case in point. Migration from that country to Australia has dropped off quite a lot. People are not coming from the eastern States of Europe in anything like the numbers that came here in the earlier part of our migration programme. Moreover, the Mediterranean people see in their own countries greater opportunities for themselves and their children. I am reminded of this little poem - "

The subject of nationalism was raised by  Senator McManus.  It is of extreme importance for us to understand the nature of nationalism in Europe. Nationalism was not expressed in that little poem, because we of this continent, coming as we do from various ethnic groups in the world, are being welded into a brotherhood. The main cause of the bitterness, the strife and the wars that have occurred over the centuries in Europe is ignorance based on nationalism. People have been separated into religious and ethnic groups and led to hate their neighbours. The result is that a line has been drawn across the map and on one side of that line are to be found the goodies and on the other side the baddies. That sort of thing has been for the aggrandisement often of little puppets, upstart kings, princes and other chieftains. So the bitterness that has existed in Europe over the centuries has been perpetuated. "

In formulating our own migration policy we are doing an excellent job in trying to break down the old bitterness that existed and in trying to encourage new settlers to have their children assimilated in the community. The older people find the language barrier very difficult to overcome. We should not try to force citizenship on people who do not wish to accept it, because deep down in their own hearts they feel as did the poet who wrote - 
 
Breathes there  a  man, with soul  so dead, 
 
Who never to himself hath said, 
 
This is my own, my native land! 
 
The economic or political situation in the country from which the migrant has come may change in time and he may want to return. It is asking a lot of a man who has any spirit in him to swear by Almighty God that he will sever his allegiance to that country. I hope that this part of our migration policy will .be examined very closely and that this objectionable part of a very fine ceremony will be eliminated. If we encourage national groups we shall only sow the seeds of strife and bitterness in line with the long history of developments of this sort in Europe. We have an opportunity here to build a new group or unit of people. We can establish a common denominator for the whole of the human race, constituted regardless of race and creed and, I hope, of colour. Australia can be made a country where decent God-fearing men and women can live in peace with their fellow men. "

I had the honour to enjoy the personal friendship of this truly great man. Over the years I learned the tremendous scope of his intellect' and his basic and inherent simplicity. One would not expect to find interests of the most simple kind in a man of such vast talents in such a wide field, but I found that he had a love of the arts - of music, poetry, . painting, flowers and scenery.  His  concern over a sick child, a bereaved widow or a distressed family revealed a kindness, a warm heartedness and a generosity on the same massive scale as his intellect.  His  achievements in public life, whether in the field of law, as a member of this Parliament, in Australian international affairs or at the United Nations made him a legend in his own lifetime. Elegant tributes have been paid to him by  Senator Henty, Senator McKenna, Senator McKellar  and 
 
It was obvious that his character had been moulded on a firm, inherited foundation, but its highlights were his basic honesty, integrity, courage and selflessness. As the controversies of his time become dimmed, the true worth of Bert Evatt's life will be seen in proper perspective. To his devoted wife Mary Alice, to Peter, Rosemary and his brothers and relatives I offer my most sincere and affectionate sympathy. "

- I refer to the Government that took a long time to become enlightened to the value of community effort and of protecting the smaller people in the community. 1 am referring to the Government that the newly arrived senator is behind. It is seeing the light. The message that the Opposition has been trying to tell the Government for so many years is gradually permeating and percolating through. We are glad to see that the honey industry is organised in the same way as the poultry and sugar industries are organised. We sincerely hope that the wool growers will achieve such organisation. 
 
Tasmanians have an interest in the measure before the Senate. Perhaps we have a better weather pattern than have other parts of this continent of which we are all proud to be inhabitants. We cannot neglect the small component parts of our economy which are each contributing their little bit. The lastest statistics I could obtain for the honey industry relate to 1963-64. In that year Tasmania produced for export honey worth about £50,000. That is not a great, spectacular amount, but it is the effort of an industry which is using to the full the great natural gifts of this country. Our trees produce the right type of nectar for the unpaid servants, the wonderful little civilised animals - the bees - to collect. I wish we could learn a lesson from them on the value of co-operation and of helping one another to achieve an objective. The bees fill their hives and there is honey for all. 
 
In speaking to support this measure, I believe that the Government is becoming more enlightened when it encourages the assistance of our smaller industries. In this legislation the Government has incorporated a little elasticity. I suppose a good soldier does what he is told to to, but in peace time a good soldier or a public servant should have a little discretion and discrimination. The Government would be unwise to direct that every pound of honey produced should bring a halfpenny into Consolidated Revenue. The Government is enlightened enough to say: ""Why should we spend a fiver on collecting five bob?"" Those people who produce only 120 lb. of honey a month are exempted from the trouble and disability of presenting reports and filling in papers. I believe that is a commendable part of this legislation. I look forward to the expansion of the honey industry and an increase in its contribution to our economic prosperity. An incentive is offered to people to go out into the uninhabited areas, for that is where the bee sucks. As the poem has it - 
 
Where the bee sucks, there suck I. 
 
In Tasmania the bee sucks in places to which I do not travel, such as the uninhabited areas of the west coast. Each bee garners his own little contribution and takes it to the hive. In this way, the island State of Tasmania is able to produce annually about 500,000 lb. of honey. I do not believe that the Victorian bees are any more industrious than Tasmanian bees, but there are more of them. I hope that the Tasmanian honey industry will continue to take its rightful place. Flavours are important. The coffee people advertise their product as the beans that taste the best. That is a gimmick. Tasmanian honey tastes very good on the breakfast table, and what is better than having breakfast with your own honey? I believe that this legislation represents advanced thinking by the Government. It has found that to help people to help themselves is a progressive way to expand a democratic society. I hope that the wool growers will take a hint from the honey producers. "

Ring out the false, ring in the true. Ring out the feud of rich and poor, Ring in redress to all mankind, Ring out false pride in place and blood, Ring in the common love of good. 
 
It is now officially admitted that there is nothing wrong with the foundations and that the cost of restoration of the tower and the clock would be only £130,000. That figure includes provision for a contingency fund of £20,000, so that the actual official estimate has come down considerably. The department was said to be afraid to tackle the task of restoration because the cost was supposed to be so great. I ask the Minister representing the 
 
Postmaster-General to give ear unto our cry and to restore the clock tower. I am sure honorable senators will agree that the restoration of this wonderful clock should be given priority by the PostmasterGeneral in his planning for the next Budget. 
 
I again urge the Federal Government to give financial aid to national trusts and historical societies in each State, so that they may have the funds necessary to collect the priceless relics in our country and to preserve them for our enjoyment and for posterity. I remember reading once that yesterday's trash may be the treasure of to-morrow. Things that are now regarded as junk may be rescued as jewels by another generation.

- Queensland certainly has power; but I will concede to  Senator Henty  that we cannot generate power as cheaply as it can be generated in Tasmania with its hydro-electric schemes. However, Queensland has an unlimited supply of coal. This coal-field about which I am now speaking is estimated to have 1,000,000,000 tons of coal. It is difficult to appreciate the magnitude of such a quantity of coal. Yet nothing will be done with it, except that it will be exported. 
 
I remember reading years ago some poems by C. J. Dennis. He wrote about The Glugs of Gosh. The Glugs were a group of people who were happy to sell their stones and rocks to people who visited them. The payment was in trinkets or something glittering - something to amuse them. This arrangement continued and The Glugs of Gosh traded all their stones and rocks to the people who called upon them. I say that the people of Queensland at present are like The Glugs of Gosh. They are trading their natural resources for money which will go quickly and leave them with nothing in place of their natural resources. Queensland wants something of greater economic value than what it will get out of this agreement. It will certainly provide a little employment for some people. The coal has to be won from the mines. The railway line, if it eventuates, will have to be constructed from Gladstone to the coal-field. Then there will be the loading, the unloading and so on. A place will be needed to stockpile the coal as it is brought into Gladstone. I appreciate all those things; but they will provide employment for only a few people, whereas, if we had some works in which the coal could be used to greater advantage, we would be well on the way to providing more employment for the people of Queensland.

I want to talk on a few more subjects. The first is geriatrics. I give credit to the Government for what it has done. It has done a magnificent job in granting a subsidy of £2 for £1 for homes for aged persons, but there is an increasing need for more to be done. The number of old people we see in general practice is growing and growing and growing. The moral obligation to look after your own old folk has gone. No one has got it to-day. The moment one of the older folk becomes sick, the attitude is, "" Get him into hospital. Can't you get rid of him? I have to mind the kids."" It is not so much a refusal to accept a moral obligation as the fact that social conditions have changed. For instance, to-day people do not have servants, and there is no room for the older people in the houses being built to-day. It all adds up to the fact that you must get rid of the old people. Let me quote this little poem - "

- That is so. He especially wanted the Melbourne-Adelaide line to be standardized. He pressed also for the fulfilment of the terms of the agreement made with  Mr. Ward  during the term of the Chifley Government - for the standardization of all the lines of South Australia. 
 
The committee was unable to make any progress with  Sir Thomas  at that time. Many members of the committee felt that the Broken Hill-Port Pirie rail link was the most important of the three that were showing up because, if that job were completed, an unbroken 4-ft. 8i-in. track would be provided from Brisbane to Sydney, Sydney to Broken Hill, thence to Port Pirie, on to Port Augusta and right across to Kalgoorlie. It would have been a very long haul from Brisbane right through to Kalgoorlie. Many of us though that that project should have No. 1 priority. In view of 
 
Australian Government had co-operated at that time, I firmly believe that the line from Broken Hill to Port Pirie would now be a fait accompli. Even then, the committee in its recommendations did not rule out the Broken Hill-Port Pirie proposition. I have here a report of the committee which was tabled in Parliament on 31st October, 1956. Paragraph 4 on page 1 of the committee's recommendations reads, in part, as follows: - 
 
Both the Broken Hill line and the Melbourne line are of such high priority that it is difficult to decide which should be first constructed. Probably the final decision should rest on administrative considerations; i.e., the one which can be put in hand first with the full co-operation of the State Government should have priority. 
 
That is the important recommendation of the committee on this question of competition between South Australia and Victoria. The committee in its recommendations quite clearly left the door wide open for any possible change of mind on the part of the South Australian Government. As South Australia offered no co-operation, the priority went by forfeiture to Victoria. Victoria promptly offered co-operation for the construction of the line from Wodonga to Melbourne. South Australia offered no co-operation and so its interest was forfeited to Victoria. 1 would like to say that the majority of the committee privately favoured, I am sure, the Port Pirie-Broken Hill line as No. 1 priority. The whole business calls to mind the title of Adam Lindsay Gordon's famous racing poem, "" How We Beat the Favourite "". Slightly transposed it could be read as "" How the Favourite Beat Himself "". In a kindly spirit I would like to remind  Sir Thomas  Playford of the old Arab saying: "" Three things come not back - one, the sped arrow; two, the spoken word; three, the lost opportunity "".

Finally, I do not think we can refer to the life of Victor Johnson without alluding to his love of Australian poets, particularly Henry Lawson.

Vic loved that poem because he was part of that era. He came over from that industrial era which began with the strikes of '91 and 92 and continued to the early part of this century. Almost invariably - and I suppose I have heard him recite these poems more times than I care to count - he would finish up on the lighter poem of ""Sweeney "". "

He did not learn those poems in the schoolroom, because he seldom saw the inside of a schoolroom. He learnt them at the time when Lawson's poems were published in the "" Bulletin "". He learnt them in the cool of bark huts and in the shearing sheds. He had an amazing memory and often recited poems thatI have never seen in print. I suppose they were published in the "" Bulletin "" in those days. 
 
Let me say a final word about Victor Johnson. I look back to the friendship of our families, the friendship between my father and Victor and his close association with me over the years. Of all the people I have known and of all the people who have passed through this Parliament my memory of him will haunt me more than any other ghost. "

- It has been said by competent authorities that if we continue importing goods which we can make ourselves, the countries from which we import them will want more and more, and one day we may have to defend ourselves against them. That has been said about more than one country, apart from Japan. 
 
If price were to be made the god of national policy, which is the main argument advanced by  Senator Payne,  this country would be reduced to a coolie level because we should have to compete against other countries under conditions which would not be in the interests of this country. We should become a coolie nation in spirit as well as in fact. I do not think 
 

             Senator James McLachlan, in referring to the Queensland aspect of the cotton industry, said that when anything grown in Queensland was threatened the same cry was raised that if the land were not used for the purpose for which it was being used it would go out of cultivation. That has been said with truth about the sugar lands. The land on which sugar is now grown could be used for very little else if the sugar industry were smashed. It is very hot coastal land, and it could not he used, for instance, for the production of wheat. Perhaps that is just as well, because if the sugar industry were abolished and the land which it is at present occupying were turned to wheatgrowing, Queensland would become a serious competitor with New South ""Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia in the wheat markets of the world. The Commonwealth would thus face an even more difficult task in meeting the wheat position than faces it to-day. In respect of the cotton,- however, the case is different. I know very little about the land in South Australia whence the honorable senator comes, but I do know a great deal about Queensland. I have been all over it on many occasions, and I have written a good deal about it. Before the production of cotton was entered upon on a large scale in Queensland, the land which it occupies was utilized for grazing. It is only secondclass grazing country, being not so good as that in Western Queensland or in the south-eastern coastal belt, but it is fairly good land, and before the introduction of cotton-growing it was carrying a fair number of cattle. If cotton-growing were to cease the land could be used again for grazing areas on which cattle would be raised on large holdings which maintain very few people. From the view-point of closer settlement which is essential to the defence of Australia, the maintenance of the cotton industry is necessary. It is my belief, and I consider that it is the belief of all- thinking Australians, that the more people there are on the land the better it will be for this country. Goldsmith pointed with very great force in his fine poem 
 
The growing of cotton could not flourish without the existence in Australia of factories to spin the raw material into cloth. If the Australian cotton- growers were forced to ship their products under world parity conditions to other parts of the world they could not compete with countries which are producing the product under coloured-labour conditions.

- Bo far as the fiscal relationship of the western State to the federation' is concerned the boot is on the other foot; the balance of advantage, as the Treasury figures show, is entirely on the side of the federation. Honorable senators have been unsuccessful in appeal after appeal to this Parliament for something, like a reasonable adjustment of tariff rates so that the burden on Western Australia may be eased, and they now fé*i. that theirs is a voice in the wilderness and that there is no remedy for the Stale unless it gets back to the condition of freedom in fiscal matters it enjoyed before it entered the federation. The purpose of  Senator Johnston's  amendment is to give the Imperial Parliament an. opportunity to Study the position on that point. Surely there is nothing wrong iti that. There is no justice, fair play, or erven poetry in having one State of the Commonwealth, which was once the moe* loyal  of all, and sent to the war more soldiers per head of population than any other State, in such a position that its people are in a continuous state of despair and smouldering discontent.

It must be remembered that the federation of Australia was  accomplished withOUt  Western Australia.

If Western Australia is to seek relief by that means alone, it will be in the position of the man who goes to law with the devil in the court of hell. It will get nothing. Its better course is to ask the British Parliament to hold fast to the power that it has acquired from time immemorial, to give the people of any of its dependencies a constitution and te amend that constitution.

In conclusion I would say one great basic fact which underlies all the questions that are discussed on the political platform at the present moment is that nothing is done as it was done twenty years ago. We are in the presence of a new organization of society. We seem to have completely broken away from the past. The old political formulas do not fit present problems; they read now like documents recovered from a forgotten past. Things which used to be put into the party platforms of ten years ago would sound antiquated if put into a platform now. This is nothing short of a new social age, a new era of human relationships, a new stage-setting for the drama of life. Ours is a country which has lifted to the admiration of the world its ideals of absolutely free opportunity, where no man is supposed to be under any limitation, except the limitation of his character and of his mind, a place where men win or lose on their merits.  ""We must do everything possible to restore confidence in Australia among the people of the world and among our own people. If we break natural laws it entails retrogression or degradation.

- No. I, for one, am anxious to maintain Australian industrial conditions, which are entirely different from those of Britain. I do not believe that a reduction of wages, and a lowering of the standard of living, will prove a panacea for all our industrial ills. Our most pressing duty is to find employment for our unemployed workers. Recently, a conference of the International Chambers of Commerce was held in Washington, United States of America. The British Chambers of Commerce sent to the conference a strong delegation, headed by Lord Luke, and on  its return  the delegation furnished a report,  in  which it stated - 
 
It is essential to correct the disequilibrium of the balance of trade, and no other means are open to Great Britain than a drastic reduction in the volume of her imports, either by total prohibitions, or by a general tariff. 
 
The report of the British delegation is given in full in the  Statist  of the 3rd October last.  The position of Australia in the matter of international trade is not so favorable as is that of Britain. For the first eight months of the present year, Great Britain's trade with other countries, including the export of gold bullion to the amount of £20,000,000, showed an adverse balance of about £260,000,000. Owing to the absence of duties, or the low tariffs on a number of commodities, Great Britain had become the dumping ground of almost every other country, with the result that nearly 3,000,000 of her work-people had been thrown out of employment. It is a reflection on the statesmen of France to suggest that the manufacture of perfume in Australia would provoke French hostility towards us; in my opinion, the French people would take ho notice of it. This is certainly a lucrative industry in France. Quite recently a statement appeared in the Australian press to the effect that Coty. having had a matrimonial disagreement with his- wife, and the latter having retired from the business, was prepared to compensate her to the extent of £3,000,000. The perfume industry has already been established in Australia, and its extension is most desirable. Excellent boronia perfume is made from the native flower of that name, and  it  is within the range of possibility that an export trade in this particular perfume will be developed, to the great benefit of Western Australia. An English poet has written of the sweet perfume of the tuberose, but 
 
The complaint has been made that we are asked to deal with this and a number of other items in the absence of reports by the Tariff Board regarding them; but we are well aware that increased du ties have been imposed because the industrial and commercial conditions of the world have changed so suddenly that prompt and drastic action had to be taken by the Government to correct what the authority to whom I referred a few moments ago has described as "" the disequilibrium of the balance of trade."" If reports by the Tariff Board were submitted in regard to every duty embraced in the schedule, would honorable senators be guided by them ? "

. -  I have already expressed my attitude towards what . is known as the plan, and as this bill is one of the legs of that comprehensive indivisible structure, to be consistent, I must oppose it. I have already stated my opposition to the agreement bill, which has not yet reached this chamber, and to the conversion bill, which passed through this chamber yesterday. The bill now before us is the most drastic of all the measures brought forward to give effect to the plan. It aims primarily at the dislocation of the accepted policy of arbitration. It gives to Ministers and to others, but principally to Ministers, authority to deal with the salaries and conditions of labour of employees of the Commonwealth regardless of existing awards or agreements. In short, it means the parliamentary fixation of wages, salaries and conditions. At the present time this may be a good thing, but the time may come when it is not a good thing for the Parliament of this country to fix wages and conditions of labour. The bill provides for the appointment of a committee, consisting of a representative of the Public Service Board, the Public Service Arbitrator, and a government appointee. The suggestion that the employees likely to be affected should have the right of representation on that committee has not been accepted. The people vitally concerned will, therefore, have no representation, yet the committee may make recommendations to the Minister in regard to the salaries and conditions of labour of employees who are already under federal arbitration awards, or awards of State courts or industrial tribunals, and in regard to employees, such as female office cleaners, who are not under any award. Salaries of persons under contract will be altered. A man working for the Commonwealth Government under an agreement may have the terms of that agreement arbitrarily changed or repudiated  by  a Minister on the recommendation of this committee. It is a case of riding rough-shod over the principles of democratic control. If there is any truth in the statement that politics are only private morals translated into: public service, there is some justification for the allegation that private morals in this community have seriously deteriorated during the last decade. In fact, there are men in prison to-day who have committed less serious offences than are proposed to be legalized by this extraordinary measure. It permitsthe breaking of conditions of contract entered into with private citizens for the carrying out of certain work. There is a distinct departure from what have previouslybeen regarded as the fundamental principles of honesty and public service. 
 

             Senator Hoare has already alluded to the proposal to reduce the inadequate pittance provided by the Commonwealth forthe pioneers of this country. I endorse his statements. Although it has, no doubt, been proposed with the best of intentions, it seems to me to lack any element of sta tesman ship to say that the ship of State may be righted by taking 6d. a week from the pocket money of an inmate of an institution, reducing his allowance from 5s. 6d. to 5s. a week. Such pettifogging schemes will not bring about what the preposterous preamble to this bill describes as "" industrial and general prosperity."" 
 
I shall not delay the Senate very long. Part VI of the bill refers to war pensions - a meed of recognition, all too inadequate, which this nation has bestowed on soldiers, sailors and nurses injured during the war. If any contract should be solemnly honoured, surely the promise to pay the soldiers, sailors and nurses the pensions to which they are entitled should  be  honoured. The harm and discredit which will accrue from a breaking of this contract will more than outweigh  any  good that may be achieved by saving a few shillings here and there from former soldiers, sailors and nurses. Having had an intimate acquaintance with a large number of the men who served overseas, and especially those wounded during the first two years of the war; having assisted in the formation of the London branch of the Aus tralian Natives Association, which, through the Anzac Buffet, helped these men while away from home, in addition to providing more than 1,000,000 free meals, and having also basked in the reflected glory of their deeds, I hesitate to even refer to this proposal to reduce war pensions. How we were thrilled by the memorable exploits of the Anzacs, who were described by a British officer as "" The bravest things God ever made "". Will Ogilvie, the Australian poet, in taking up that theme, wrote - "

. - Although I have no desire to delay the Senate, I wish to reply to certain statements made in connexion with this measure that are contrary to fact. For instance,  Senator Rae  made the extraordinary assertion that the Government could retain the present rates of salaries and pensions by reducing the interest on bonds to a flat rate of 3 per cent. There would then, he contended, be no necessity to make the proposed cut, and the Commonwealth would have £500,000 to spare. In studying the schedule, I find that the interest rates are to be reduced t6 £3 13s. 
 
All our attempts in the past twelve months to stimulate ""a recovery of trade, to maintain the stability and usefulness of our credit structure, to restore employment and to secure to the workers and primary producers their assured reward, have been frustrated by external events and influences. 
 
If it is the considered opinion of the present Federal Treasurer that the position now confronting us is due to external causes entirely beyond the control of this Government, the late Government cannot be blamed for it. Although we all regret the necessity to reduce invalid and old-age pensions, it is a sort of poetic justice that this unpleasant task should fall to the lot of this Government. During the last election campaign, the candidates supporting the present Government strongly declared that if a Labour government were returned it would retain the existing rates of pensions. Their slogan was, "" Support us and save your oldage pensions "". Illustrated posters depicting hungry children hanging on to the bedraggled skirts of their unfortunate mothers were displayed throughout the country. The wording on the posters suggested that such a position would be brought about by a return of the Bruce-Page Government. It was not only publicly stated, but whispered in the ears of the old-age pensioners, that if the Bruce-Page Government remained in office, pensions would be reduced. "

If it were permissible for the Vice-President of the Executive Council to be poetical, I do not see why I should not be poetical also. Iri his first attempt to move the second reading of this Bill, the Vice-President of the Executive Council said that it was owing to the "" whirligig of politics "" that he found himself under the painful necessity - as I suppose it' was - of doing so. He did not admit, however, that this was a final and successful moving of such a measure. I consider that the Minister's explanations as to why he is in favour of the Bill at the present time, when we know how strongly he opposed it on previous occasions, was very laboured indeed. In fact, I think that, in the language of Lord Byron, his speech might be described as one composed in that style of rhetoric which the learned call ""rigmarole,"" because it consisted simply of sophistries strung together to cloak over the position in which the Minister found himself. The Senate is in an unfortunate position, inasmuch as this Bill has been introduced by so many Governments that there is now possibly a majority of the members of the Senate who feel themselves constrained to vote iri favour of it. Yet I venture to say that a number of those who will vote for the second reading are in their heart of hearts opposed to the Bill. "

Now, by an irony of fate, so strange that it is almost like poetic justice, we suddenly find the Government bringing in special legislation to deal, amongst others, with the very man whose alleged interests ostensibly, but really whose adroit engineering at that time, caused the introduction of the Australian Industries Preservation Bill.

- A revenue surplus of £3,000,000 extracted from a population of 4,000,000 is evidence of the unexampled prosperity or industry of the people or it is a specimen of taxation quite unexampled in the history of any country. I put this plea very strongly before members of both Houses of this Parliament, and with all the power I can before the people of Australia, because if there is to be any attempt made in another place or in this Chamber to increase the existing burden of taxation- a burden which, from some points of view, seems almost as merciless and unnecessary as the burden imposed by the Roman Pro-Consul when extracting tribute from a hostile province - the duty of showing whether the people of Australia should bear increased taxation in any form, whether through the Tariff or through States services, lies clearly upon the Government which seeks to impose it. Ora the score that industries are being strangled the facts are entirely against the Government. Never at any stage in the history of the Commonwealth, and certainly in the history of Victoria, have the manufacturing and natural industries of Australia been on a sounder ant|,  apparently, on a more permanent footing than they are at the present time. I should, I think, be doing less than my duty if I did not take advantage of this particularly opportune occasion to say that, while the Government are bound to consider the Tariff, we must approach its consideration from the point of view I have put before the Senate. During the last short session of two days I drew attention to the face that Parliament was being chloroformed and denied an opportunity to express its mind upon some very important questions, at a time when both Houses were aware that the Prime Minister proposed to attend the Imperial Conference, at which he was to speak on behalf of Australia. The honorable and learned gentleman had in his mind then, and it was in the mind of every one of us, that in attending the Imperial Conference he was bound to bring up the question of preferential trade, which was exercising the mind of a very powerful political party in the House of Commons. I took the opportunity to point out last session that when the Prime Minister did not give the Commonwealth Parliament an opportunity to express its mind upon this important question, he had weakened his own hand, and had rendered ineffective his mission to the mother country. Time has justified the prediction I then made. It seems somewhat like political, if not poetic, justice that when this Parliament was closed against discussion the Prime Minister had the misfortune, and, perhaps from another point of view, the good fortune, to discover that upon the very question on which he professed to place so much importance the door of the British Parliament was closed against him by the Ministry which then held power in Great Britain. He experienced on the other side the treatment he had given to the two Houses of Parliament here. It is noted by constitutional writers, and by writers who still, examine very closely the birth, development, and modern tendencies of our Constitution, that our so-called democratic constitutions are gradually merging into a system which, through Ministers of the Crown, gives the Crown greater powers than were possessed by the Tudors or the Stuarts. Upon such matters as our relations with the Empire, and preferential trade as a factor in the development of the Empire, it is not the wishes or the views of the Prime Minister, or of any political party that should prevail, but the views and considered judgment of Parliament. Honorable senators are, I think, but doing their duty to their constituents .and to the Parliament to which they belong * in objecting when the opportunity is given them to any tendency on the part of Ministers, as Ministers, to deprive Parliament of its privileges or in any way to minimize or disregard them. ' It would have been infinitely better for himself, and for the Ministry, if, before he went to the Imperial Conference, the Prime Minister had given both Houses of this Parliament an opportunity to express their minds upon these important questions, in order that when he went to the Conference he might be able, in expressing  Ms views,  to say that he had consulted one of the most important Parliaments in the Empire, and that the demand, whatever it might be, which he made upon the mother country was such as the deliberate judgment of that Parliament, or the majority in it, entitled him to make.

âMr President, last yearâs federal election produced a remarkable electoral trinity. For the first time since Menziesâ success in 1955 a Liberal Prime Minister secured a fourth consecutive term of office. Second, it was the first time since 1980 and, more importantly, since the Senate was expanded in 1984 that any government had been able to secure a majority in both houses of the parliament. Third, it was the first time in a half Senate election that the Liberal Party of Queensland was able to secure the return of three senators.
 
Queenslanders made an impressive contribution to the first and second of these successes and, of course, were wholly responsible for the third. One consequence of this success is that Queenslanders now outnumber Victorians in the Liberal party room. Although I was born in Melbourne, I record this historic development with considerable delight and satisfaction.
 
Much attention has been given to the apparently dire consequences which will almost certainly follow from the governmentâs new Senate majority. For some, it seems, democracy has come to an inglorious end. I very much doubt whether the poet John OâBrien had the Senate in mind when he had Hanrahan proclaim, âWeâll all be rooned,â but for many it seems that farmerâs despair has a modern resonance. In truth, the new Senate keeps faith with a profoundly significant constitutional idea: namely, that at the heart of Australiaâs parliamentary system there should exist a strong, democratically elected upper house. As Dr John Quick remarked at the 1897 Federal Convention, âWe are creating a Senate that will feel the sap of popular election in its veins.â At the time, this was a bold experiment in constitutional design and, for over a century, it has been an enduring source of the Senateâs political legitimacy."

In discussing Australiaâs commemoration of VP Day, I think it would be remiss to not make reference to the horrendous weapons that did indeed bring the world to a standstill and force the surrender of Japan. I am of course referring to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and 9 August 1945. We all listened with interest to the reminiscences and the stories of those experiences in recent weeks as well. I have visited the memorial and the park in Hiroshima. It is an extraordinarily compelling and confronting experience, particularly for one who grew up in an Australian World War II veteranâs family with a very interesting perspective of our engagement against the Japanese. It is one of the most impressive memorials I have ever seen. Its commemoration is, I think, a very important part of the modern world.
 
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has used the 60th anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the commemoration of VP Day to urge all nations to abandon their nuclear weapons program. The nuclear non-proliferation program is really one of the most important projects of the 21st century and one that Australia pursues with great energy and seriousness in tackling what is an enormous challenge for us in this century. This is so particularly in light of the changes in the interaction between nations and the intervention of non-state players in those interactions. This makes for a very different landscape from what was perhaps 60 years ago a more predictable environment in terms of battle and confrontation, upon which to draw a picture for the future of conflict and, in fact, the prevention of conflict.
 
I hope that I am forgiven by the Senate for personalising my observations about VP Day, but when we come to this place we come with the influence of our families and their histories and we bring the experiences that they visited upon us. I began by making reference to WS Kent Hughes and his extraordinarily evocative writings in  Slaves of the Samurai  and how very compelling it is to read those. But there are many other war poets who have made an extraordinary contribution throughout not just Australiaâs history but also internationally in terms of the recording of experience, of horror in many cases, of humour in so many Australian cases and of emotion generally about war."

There is a wonderful anthology of poetry of the Australian Army which contains many interesting reminiscences of the south-west Pacific area, Australia, Papua New Guinea, Bougainville and Borneo from 1942 to 1945. Some of the poetsâ work contained therein bring a wry smile, some are positively horrific and terrifying and some are just so emotionally draining that they are hard to read at length. I did want to make another brief reference to a poem called  Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels  which was dedicated to Sapper Victor Cook from the Royal Australian Engineers. The last few lines sum up some of the things that my father often said about fighting in Papua New Guinea. It says:"

She had a supportive family and a supportive husband, whom she pays particular tribute to in her autobiography. In fact, she makes some funny comments about how the spouses of female politicians were treated during those times. After her decision to retire, the  Courier-Mail  in 1973 published a poem on the announcement of her retirement. If I may, I will read it to the chamber, hopefully very quickly:"

Kipling was a second-rate poet renowned for his glorification of the British Empire. Today he would probably be a candidate for the National Party. But, if I may, I would urge Senator Joyce to forget Kipling and instead consider the words of Macbeth. They are far more apposite and indeed prophetic:"

The Ministerâs allegations were based on a selective and misleading quotation from a poem I wrote four years ago, while living in Quebec City, and which was published in the  Sydney Morning Herald  on 17 September 2001. The poem was called âThe President and the Terroristâ, although the Herald amended the title to simply read âThe Terroristâ. The message of the poem was simple and tragically prophetic: that responses to terrorism that kill innocent people will only lead to more violence and advance the terroristsâ cause. A reading of the poem demonstrates this:"

There is no ambiguity about terrorism in this poem â the terrorist is a âghoulish monsterâ who is âwaiting for the body count to riseâ. The message of the poem was obvious to those who read it. For example, an Iranian living in Quebec City wrote to me on 15 September 2001:"

The poem has been unquestionably been misrepresented by the Minister. The use of phrases like âmoral equivocation about terrorismâ, âextremeâ and âno compunction whatsoever about deliberately misrepresentingâ are designed to discredit me and dissuade me from participating in public debate on industrial relations. Equally, the attack is aimed at dissuading the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from broadcasting any of my analyses on industrial relations, as the Minister also claimed that âThe ABC does itself and the Australian people no service by presenting someone like David Peetz as a ârespected academicââ."

Instead, the Minister asserted that I did âresearch sponsored by the ACTUâ. He failed to mention that this research was funded by the Commonwealth Government through the Australian Research Council, and was approved by the then Minister for Education, Dr Kemp. Nor did he mention that I have done research and consultancy work for such employers as Brisbane City Council, Redland City Council and Queensland Rail, and for the Department of Workplace Relations and Small Business under a Liberal Minister. He asserted that I was âreported as being a singer in a trade union choirâ, failing to mention that I left the Brisbane Combined Unions Choir, after a short period, in 2000. He asserted that I wrote âpoetry for the Workers Online web site, which calls him its âresident bardââ, failing to point out that my poems (uncensored by that publication) satirised both sides of politics, that I wrote as many articles for the  Courier-Mail  as I wrote poems for Workers Online in 2005, that I have also written pieces for the employersâ magazine "

âIt is with great sadness that I advise the Senate of the death of a great Queenslander and servant of Australia, Mr Hugh Alexander Dunn. Mr Dunn was part of that extraordinary generation of Australians who joined the then Department of External Affairs either during or in the aftermath of World War II and who went on to lay the foundations of an independent Australian foreign policy. They were an academically accomplished group of men and women and they had a strong belief that Australia should have its own distinctive voice in international affairs. Hugh Dunn personified the best of them: dedicated to creating a professional foreign service and, as time went on, especially committed to Australiaâs closer engagement with Asia.
 
Hugh was born in Rockhampton on 20 August 1923. The Dunn family eventually moved to Brisbane, where he was educated briefly at state schools and then at Brisbane Boys College. At the college he was both an academic and an athletic star. He was captain and dux in his final year and received colours for cricket, rowing, rugby and athletics. He was an especially talented rugby player, eventually representing Queensland. After leaving school in 1942, Hugh was drawn by the war into military service. He was attached to General MacArthurâs headquarters and was to become part of the first signals intelligence unit in Australia. He served with MacArthur in New Guinea and the Philippines and after the war made his way to exotic locales in Asia, especially Japan and China. At the warâs conclusion he returned to Brisbane and a Bachelor of Arts degree at the University of Queensland. It was here that Hugh began to explore the subject which was to become a defining dimension of his public and private life: a fascination with China and its place in the world.
 
When he was announced as the Queensland Rhodes Scholar for 1949, it gave him the opportunity to undertake Chinese language training at Oxford University, where he studied with some of the most eminent names in the field. He graduated with first-class honours in Chinese in 1952 with a thesis that translated some of the poems of the second century poet Cao Zhi. The translation was later published in both Taiwan and the Peopleâs Republic."

âNot to get too poetic at this reasonably early hourâI think I will save that for laterâthere is a collection of phrases that I have never forgotten which someone put before me when I was much, much younger.

Senator Abetz made an initial submission of seven pages, canvassing in a rather ill-tempered, intemperate sort of a way issues that were under scrutiny. The arrival of submissions from the public and even from the staff of the Senate led Senator Abetz to make a supplementary submissionâa 43-page submission at that. It has been one of the more interesting pieces of government propaganda I have seen in recent times. He sought deliberately to misrepresent the opinions that he disagreed with of those who had made submissions. The real offence, as I said, was against the Clerk, who was somewhat unwise, in Senator Abetzâs view, to quote a 19th-century poet, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who commented on the question of accountability and people protesting their innocence. The Clerk said:"

What a crime to quote poetry. What a crime to suggest that governments occasionally protest too much. What a crime to suggest that there was an issue with the way governments seek to cover their tracks in terms of their official positions. What we have here is vindictive abuse of those who made submissions. He questioned motives. He imputed ill-intent. He refused to accept that not just the Clerk but a whole range of people may have legitimate concerns about the way the governmentâs advertising programs were being run. The minister is essentially acting here as a new sort of administrative Rasputin: a mad monk driven by conspiracies, fantasies and a desire for revenge."

âI too would like to speak to the condolence motion moved by Senator Hill on behalf the government and spoken to by Senator Ludwig on behalf of the opposition. The Polish 263rd successor of Saint Peter died on 3 April this year aged 84, leaving his mark on the world as one of the most influential popes in the churchâs 2,000-year history and opening up the church to people all over the world. He is the most travelled pontiff in history, visiting around 100 countries in his first year alone. He encountered more individuals than any other pope, as he spread the word of God.
 
Many things to many people, Karol Jozef Wojtyla commenced his spiritual journey from a humble quarry worker, poet and actor to a much-lauded pontiff. He was the first pope to travel to England, the first to preach in a Lutheran Church and the first to enter a mosque. Revered as an heroic visionary and attacked as a remnant of a bygone era, the Pope remained true to the opinions he held since his youth. His faith and deep spirituality was shaped by the loss early in his life of his mother and brother and later by that of his father and strengthened during the Nazi occupation, when he became aware of his call to the priesthood. He is credited as giving the Polish people hope and direction after decades of communist rule, inspiring the Solidarity movement which would eventually lead Poland to abandon communism and establish its own identity away from the Soviet Union. Ordained after the war in 1946, he pursued studies in philosophy and theology before being nominated Archbishop of Krakow in the early 1960s and a cardinal in 1967.
 
His pontificate started in 1978 when, after eight rounds of voting in a secret concave, the cardinals chose the first non-Italian pope since the 16th century. It is reported that during his reign the number of Catholics in the world has risen to about 1.1 billion. As a conservative pope, John Paul II held the line against trendy Catholicism and firmly stood his ground on issues such as womenâs ordination, stem cell research and abortion. He became known as an opponent of communism, a champion of human rights and liberty, a powerful preacher and a sophisticated intellectual. He warned of the dangers of secularism, materialism and selfishness, urging people to be tolerant and to help the less fortunate. He was committed to bringing together the churches and faiths of the world, with his theme of forgiveness and harmony.
 
Such was his faith and character that following an attempt on his life by a Turk in 1981 the Pope famously visited him in prison, offering his forgiveness. In 1984 the Pope approved the first revision in Catholic canon law to make the church more accessible by increasing the power of the bishops, widening the role of laypeople and expanding the role of women in the church. Despite several health scares during the 1990s, his travel and writing continued, culminating in a publication in 1995 in which he spoke of the modern world as a âculture of deathâ, citing violence, poverty, murder, suicide, human suffering, abortion and euthanasia. In 1998, the Vatican made a step towards repairing the relationship between Jews and the Vatican by apologising for the churchâs past positions regarding Jews and anti-Semitism.
 
In his later years, the Popeâs tremendous spiritual strength overcame the limitations of his ailing body, until last month when he returned to his maker. An inspirational leader, he has touched the lives and hearts of many millions of people. This was demonstrated by the many tributes to him from people from all walks of life, following his passing. He will be sadly missed."

 The Australian Government has provided $5.3 million for the Partnership Outreach Education Model Pilot (POEM) to date and has agreed to provide a further $2.6 million to extend the Pilot until December 2006. POEM provides an education and personal development programme targeting young people (aged 13 to 19) who are disconnected from mainstream schooling. POEM offers flexible accredited education and training options delivered in supported community settings and places emphasis on the acquisition of appropriate life skills. POEM is underpinned by partnerships and positive relationships between young people and their families, community service agencies, schools, government at all levels and business.

Instead of actually presenting an argument against the academic work of Professor David Peetz, Senator Abetz attacked him personally. He said that because, he had done research that had been sponsored by the ACTU, he could certainly not be considered to be independent in any way. It was quite a bizarre approach considering academics are often engaged by all sides of the political debate to do academic work to study the effects of different policy. The fact that people work for both sides from time to time does not discredit their academic work. He went on to accuse him of being a singer in a trade union choir. He accused him of writing poetry. What a terrible offence it must be. He accused him of writing âtasteless and infantile materialâ and went on to accuse him of engaging in âmoral equivocation about terrorismâ. But not once did he challenge the academic work that Professor David Peetz submitted."

It was revived when, in 1970, the Gorton government appointed him to succeed Sir Frank Kitto when he retired from the High Court. He served as a justice of the court for 17 yearsâfor the last seven of them as Chief Justiceâuntil his retirement in 1987. He served the court and the Australian people with exemplary distinction. He was never controversialânot a small virtue in a judge, although one which is less appreciated nowadays than it should be. His judgments across the whole gamut of the law were always closely argued and convincing. He never engaged in judicial rhetoric and, although in his private life he had a great love of English literatureâin particular, poetryâone will scour his extensive judgments in vain for a single purple passage. Yet his judgments are models of clarity and lucid expression in which he arrived at his conclusions through rigorous, exhaustive and intellectually honest reasoning."

Fractions and percentages matter for kids. The ability to master mathematical operations and calculations is critical for numeracy. Mental arithmetic, times tables and long division are not arcane; they are the skills our kids need for life. Guesswork, fuzzy maths and calculators are a cop-out. Spelling, grammar, sentence structure, punctuation and vocabulary are necessary for a literate societyânot so-called whole language learning. Indeed, as young Australians, our kidsâ birthright should be to inherit the great traditions of Australian and English literature. The poems of Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson and the plays of Shakespeare should mean something to our children. Even the simple pleasure of playing a musical instrument is denied to so many of our children. Only 23 per cent of children at state schools have access to music education. The blame for this lies fairly and squarely at the trendy âwhole of artsâ education promulgated by so many state Labor governments."

Most of his working career has been in the education field. He was an English teacher and his love of language permeates the book. In  A Passion for Life âand I strongly encourage people to get hold of this book and confront the journey that Paul and his family are going throughâPaul quotes deeply from various literary sources and poetry that he and his youngest daughter have written. In his book he has inserted aspects of what it is like to be a little girl watching your dad disappear in front of youâa man who used to teach you to play cricket. Cricket is one of the passions that I share with Paul. He just wants to teach his daughter how to bowl a proper leg spinnerâsomething that we would all like to know how to do.
 
Paul is unable to physically write at all now, so when he was autographing his book, his two daughters were sitting beside him. He would say what he would like written, and they would write it for him. That was another shared experience of their family living with motor neurone disease.
 
Tomorrow, I am hoping that across Australia and the world, because this is an international cause, people will become involved and will look at ways to raise funds and to pressure governments and researchers across the world that there is a cure for MNDâwe just have to find it. When I was talking to Paul I mentioned that when I was young I watched a movie about Lou Gehrig, the American baseballer. We were talking about the way the condition strikes: you begin to have tingling in your arms or legs and then gradually you lose feeling and control. He said that, while Mr Gehrig was a great baseballer, Paul was a great cricketer. I hope that with him and his family, we as a community can work to find the cure for âthis bloody mongrel of a conditionâ."

âI thank Senator Brandis for his question and his genuine interest in ensuring that the 500,000 Australians who are currently unemployed will have the opportunity of gaining employment, because the current unfair dismissal laws are acting as a disincentive to job creation, denying thousands of our fellow Australians the opportunity of employment.
 
The unfair dismissal laws are a failed social experiment and commonsense now dictates that they should be changed. Recently I told the Senate about a case in my home state of Tasmania. This week we heard about another case, in Queensland, where the state education department was reportedly prevented by unfair dismissal laws from dismissing a teacher for continued inappropriate moonlightingâand let us just say it was in a profession that has a longer history than education.
 
The current unfair dismissal laws are wrong and they need to be changed. Bob Carr knew it; Mr Beazley knows it; the unions know it; we all know it. But it is only this side of the parliament that is actually prepared to do something about it. Yet, despite knowing that the laws need fixing, those opposite continue to stand in the way by making misleading claims.
 
These untruths are also being peddled by so-called independent experts, such as David Peetz from Griffith University, who appeared on the ABCâs  AM  program on Thursday and made a number of outrageous claims. One would have to ask: what would motivate an independent expert to make such claims? I suggest that Mr Peetz is not independent. He has strong links with the union movement, including doing research sponsored by the ACTU. He has been reported as being a singer in a trade union choir, and he writes poetry for the Workers Online web site, which calls him its âresident bardâ. Here he writes tasteless and infantile material such as 
 
Yes, evil will be overcome by good, but sir, you see,
 
I know you are the evil one, and good is on my side!
 
You are the force of Satanâand that is why I died.
 
The ABC does itself and the Australian people no service by presenting someone like David Peetz as a ârespected academicâ, trying to tell the people of Australia that he is somehow independent. If Senator Santoro were here I would suggest to him that he might now have 601 questions to ask of the ABC. A person who engages in moral equivocation about terrorism will have no compunction whatsoever about deliberately misrepresenting our modest workplace relations changes. These are the extreme people in this debate, not the government with our reforms."

âThank you to all those who contributed to this condolence motion. I think we have heard today just what a fine person Peter Cook was.

âThis afternoon, I want to say a few words about what will, I believe, come to be seen as one of the transforming events of the early 21st century. I speak of the elections for the Iraqi national assembly and for 18 provincial councils, which were held on 30 January. I want to speak in particular of the courage of the millions of Iraqi citizens who, braving dire threats of intimidation by the enemies of democracy, made those elections such a triumphant vindication of those whose sacrifice brought democracy to Iraq, and I want to pose the question: while the struggle to create a democratic state in Iraq was at its fiercest, where was the Left?
 
Have you ever noticed how much the rhetoric and symbolism of the political Left is dominated by the language of war and struggle? Those on the Left speak of the class war and the class struggle; radicals, particularly in universities, delight in being described as militants; terrorists are commonly called freedom fighters; Third World populations are constantly being urged to wage war against their oppressors, usually the United States and other democracies; and postcolonial civil wars are invariably described as wars of national liberation. From Marx to Marcuse, the central concept of their political universe is revolution. In fact, one of the most enduring items of late 20th century kitsch is the image of the bereted and bandoliered guerrilla Che Guevara in the pose of iconic freedom fighter. Yet, notwithstanding the Leftâs romanticisation of violence and idealisation of the revolutionary warrior, their victories are almost all rhetorical. Those of the Left are curiously absent when it comes to fighting the real wars of national liberation.
 
Nobody captured the mismatch between the heroic rhetoric of the Left and its moral cowardice better than did George Orwell, who, having himself fought and been grievously injured in the Spanish Civil War, knew a thing or two about what wars look like from the point of view of the people actually fighting them. In one of the greatest political essays ever written, âInside the Whaleâ, Orwell quoted from the then fashionable Leftist posturing of WH Auden in his poem about that war:"
592,9/2/05,41,1,2,SENATE,122,0,9/2/05,Senator BRANDIS,008W7,Address-in-Reply,MISCELLANEOUS,Queensland,LP,"Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts",1,0,"
 
Orwell wrote of that stanza that it was:
 
... intended as a sort of thumbnail sketch of a day in the life of âa good party manâ. In the morning a couple of political murders, a ten minutesâ interlude to stifle âbourgeoisâ remorse, and then a hurried luncheon and a busy afternoon chalking walls and distributing leaflets. All very edifying. But notice the phrase ânecessary murderâ. It could only be written by a person to whom murder is at most  a word....  Mr Audenâs brand of amoralism is only possible if you are the kind of person who is always somewhere else when the trigger is being pulled. So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who donât even know that fire is hot.
 
Orwell, the soldier who actually fought in the Spanish Civil War, never glamorized violence; Auden, the Leftist poet reclining comfortably in Hampstead, could afford to write cheaply of armed struggle, secure in the knowledge it would always be other people who did the fighting."

âI lack entirely the poetic flair of the previous speaker, so I will labour on without such eloquence. I would like to take this opportunity to speak briefly about the Liberals who are retiring, the South Australians who are retiring and, of course, the great and respected father of this house. Unfortunately, I cannot speak about all of those who are retiring in this remarkable phenomenon of 20 per cent of the Senate going."

âThe  Australian Citizenship Legislation Amendment Bill 2002  is non-controversial but I would have hoped that a deal of time was put aside for its debate. It is about the underpinning of Australian nationality, and that is a matter which we as a parliament ought to talk about at length. There is an interesting concept that you must be an Australian citizen to be in the Australian military forces or to be in the reserves. That indicates that there is importance attached to the concept of Australian nationality. But with the passing of this legislationâand it has been discussed, as Senator Bolkus has said, for years nowâthe fact is that you will be able to hold any number of citizenships of any number of countries and, at the same time, be Australian. 
 
I am really talking nostalgically. I do not think nostalgia is all that bad at times. I became an Australian citizen in 1948, when the act was originally passed. I was born in Tasmania; my fatherâwho had the same name as me, Barney Cooneyâwas born there in July 1894. In spite of the fact that my mother, Corrie Curtain, was also born in Tasmania on 26 February 1899, and three of my grandparents were born there, the fourth one was a foreigner from Ballaratâin those days, Ballarat was in a foreign country; I was born British.
 
Great contributions were made to Australia in the 19th century. This legislation is in keeping with where Australia has developed to. I like to think that, although Australia is developing in a great way and we have a great multicultural society, those who came in the 19th century and before did make a great contribution. The indigenous people were, of course, the first people here.  
 
I am always very pleased, in light of some of my ancestry, that 26 January is Australia Day. That is the day that the convicts founded Australia. That was the day that they got here, and they were the first to till the soil in this land. They were followed by the graziers, squatters, the selectors that we used to learn about in school, and the miners. And we developed to the stage we have reached now. I think it is good to contemplate the contribution that the earlier settlers made to Australia. We learnt about those sorts of things at school. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will remember the great poem by Dorothea Mackellar, which is the one that often comes to mind:  My Country , which contains the lines `I love a sunburnt country'â"

âI was at David Hamer's funeral and I, sadly, learnt more about Davidâas one often does at somebody's funeralâthan I knew when he was here. He will be remembered for the remarkable contributions he made to Australian society and for the diversity of those contributions. In our current age of specialisation, I remember David Hamer as a man who could really turn his hand to anything. He brought an enormous set of skills and life experience to his work in this parliamentâ and I guess that is something that those who are given the responsibility of preselecting people ought to think carefully about: the value of preselecting people who have a wide range of skills and backgrounds. People have mentioned the distinguished career he had in the House as the member for Isaacs before finding a home in this chamber. I think he had a special affinity for the Senate; maybe it suited him best. Those of us in the Senate always think that we have a different culture from those in the House of Representatives. People make the transition this way better than they make the transition the other way. He was very committed to the Senate committee system and his interest in the Senateâand I suppose his understanding of the staff of the Senateâwas expressed in a poem he was known to recite at odd moments:"

âYes, Senator Faulkner; I knew that you would think they were in Leeton. I know you think it is because you and I had a photo taken outside your childhood home in Leeton during the campaign. The photo was to appear on the front page of the paper. It appeared on the front page of the paper, but there was only Senator Faulkner there; I did not appear and neither did our candidate. I do not think they were all in Leeton, but I would like to say to those 245: thank you very much. I have always challenged our lower house colleagues, when they go on about having slim margins, by saying to them, `Well, if you extrapolate this out across the 50 seats, as there were, in New South Wales, I have got a margin of about nine or 10. I could not afford to go and offend five people in each of your electorates; so beat that.' That has usually shut them up. 
 
The Senate is an important place. It plays a valuable role in the democracy of this country. I think it is a rather individual place; there is probably really nothing like it elsewhere in the world.
 
âStop trying to put me off, Senator Bolkus. But it does play an important role. I appreciate that fully, and I wish you all well. There is a poem that I always remember the first line of:"

âThe  Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002  is legislation that should give us concern. It is very radical legislation and is the sort of legislation that somebody with a conservative soul like mine is rather shocked by. I am sure that we will talk about this anon, because this legislation changes the very culture and the very climate that have prevailed in this community until now. For example, under sections 23A to 23W of the Crimes Act, there is a series of provisions that protect our most precious rights, the most precious of those attributes that make us citizens of Australia and that identify us as such. 
 
Mr Acting Deputy President, over the years I have heard you speak in favour of the democracy that prevails in Australia. This legislation seeks to change the whole fabric of our society. One great illustration of that is that until now we could not be taken from the streets simply to be questioned so that information could be gained from us. We could not be taken from the streets, detained and put into custody for that purpose. This legislation will take away that sacred right that we enjoy as a community. This is well expressed by Robert John Clark, an Australian poet and a solicitor, in his poem  The Nameless Men , which was published in the 1960s, and in which he said:"

âIt is our duty in this place to mark the passing of a great Australian whose life set an example of harmony and unity in these times of discord and division. His name was David Gordon Kirkpatrick, and we all knew him as Slim Dusty. Slim epitomised the true values of the Australian working people, including loyalty, mateship, love of the bush and support for the battler. His was a life filled with humility, humour, recognition of the unsung or forgotten people in our society, both men and women, and the principle of a fair go. He has been compared with Henry Lawson, whose works were his lifelong inspiration, as were the poems of Banjo Paterson. "

Slim Dusty was a pioneer, poet and an ever-present performer rolled all into one, an unassuming giant amongst us, plain in speech, humble and fair in character.
 
The huge state funeral was a privilege Slim deserved. It was an opportunity for those who were touched by his life and his music, from bush and city, from all racial and social backgrounds, from the most powerful to the simplest in the land, to acknowledge his life and to say goodbye.
 
Slim Dusty's success lay in the fact that it did not matter who or where you were; having a beer in sideshow alley at a dusty rodeo in Rockhampton or sipping chardonnay in suburban Sydney, Slim's songs evoked memories for all of us about the things we remember and hold dear about our childhoods and how life used to be. Slim Dusty's whole life can be aptly summed up in the title of his 100th album,  Looking Forward, Looking Back . His is an enduring legacy for us all."

It is a fact that more and more female teachers have to face physically intimidating and disrespectful boys. Boys in these circumstances create stress but they themselves are suffering. In fact, girls outperform boys in almost every subject area. In our analysis of where education policy should be moving, two elements stand out as essential debating points. The first is a later starting age for boys, whose fine motor skills and cognitive skills generally are slower to develop than those of girls. The second is more men in schoolsâmen of the right kind, men with a mixture of warmth and sternness, men who are obviously in charge but not in a way that necessarily challenges boys negatively. In this regard a now widely known experiment at a British school in shifting to single gender English classes is worth examining. At the Cotswold School, a coeducational secondary school in England, boys and girls in the fourth year of secondary school were placed in gender-segregated English classes for two years. As the new single gender classes got under way, teachers adjusted the curriculumâthe choices of books and poemsâto make it more interesting for the boys or girls in their class. They were no longer restricted by a need to strike a middle path between the interests of boys or girls. The classes began to take on a distinctly boys' or girls' flavour. The Cotswold results were impressive. Where the UK national statistics record only nine per cent of 14-year-old boys achieving grades in the A to C range in English, Cotswold recorded 34 per cent of boys, after two years in the single gender classes, having winning grades in the A to C range in their final exams, an increase of almost 400 per cent in the number of boys scoring high grades. The girls' performance improved too. At the end of the two-year experiment 75 per cent of girls got scores in the A to C range, compared with 46 per cent a year before. 
 
This is food for thought. I note that there are lessonsâno pun intended of courseâfor Australian educational authorities to consider. Essentially one thing is obvious: we need to reverse the trend of declining male teacher numbers and we need to encourage males to think of the teaching vocation as one which is most worthy of pursuit, as indeed males have thought of it over the past century. I intend to canvass the broader community in relation to this most important issue. I believe that the community will be most interested in participating in this debate and in contributing ideas as to incentives that can be provided or made available to males within our society who are thinking of becoming teachers but then decide not to. The reasons for this are many, and I intend to discuss them in this place at some other time."

The Palma Rosa Poets group is another way that the ESU in Queensland explores the endless potential and possibilities of the language. Regular evening meetings are held, with presentations of the works of well-known Australian poets and with a strong emphasis on the lore of the Australian bush. There are theatre groups, through which members receive invitations to attend stage performances of various theatre productions, often with supper afterwards to meet the cast. Many well-known local and overseas stars have been their guests from time to time. Throughout the year, the ESU in Queensland also arranges a series of social functions. Most significant annual events, such as Anzac Day, the Queen's Birthday, National Flag Day, the Melbourne Cup and others are marked in some way by a social gathering. Most of these activities are traditionally held at Palma Rosa. The picture of the English Speaking Union activities in Queensland is indeed a very good oneâa rosy one, some would sayâalthough, of course, such an organisation could always find room for more members.
 
There is no doubt that the ESU is very much to the fore on the Queensland social circuit and that Queensland benefits tremendously from the presence within the community of the ESU. Honourable senators may be interested to know that the ESU was the brainchild of an Englishman, Sir Evelyn Wrench. He founded the organisation in 1918 after many years of working towards fulfilling his dream of a closer link between citizens of the English-speaking world. The Queensland branch was established in May 1968. Honourable senators may be interested to know that it is the largest branch of the ESU in Australia.
 
The ESU is fortunate to have had wonderful support from many people over the years. His Royal Highness Prince Philip, President of the ESU, opened the restored Palma Rosa during the recent CHOGM, at a function which attracted 450 invited guests. The late Sir Gordon Chalk, former Treasurer and Deputy Premier of Queensland, was a great supporter. Ralph Holden purchased Palma Rosa on behalf of the members, with a loan guaranteed by about 10 people. Mary Holden took over from Ralph, her husband, as president when he died. Sir John Rowell talked Patricia Johnson into taking over from Mary Holden as president and had the ESU reinstated as a company. Sir Walter Campbell, a former governor of Queensland, helped the now president and supported her, with Sir John, to take up the presidency after Mary Holden. Sir Walter also opened the art gallery, which was relocated to the lower level as a first priority. Doug Rea assisted the new directors in 1994 to get the constitution in order and is still on the board. Audrey Peacock OAM has been a wonderful board member since 1994. Delma Stocks, a wonderful board member also, has been treasurer since 1994 and administered the Commonwealth government grant of $800,000. Mary Josephson, without whom the restoration work would not have been successful, planted and looks after all the plants on the grounds. Ann Brown, a loyal and very good board member, assists at weekends with the open house. Edna Hart and Kath Robertson are wonderful, gracious women who run the library. They look after books donated by ESU members from all over the world and chosen by a panel of esteemed judges from the UK, and from the USA library which developed Books Across the Sea, begun by T.S. Eliot. 
 
John and Karen are directors and members, and Karen is the treasurer. Dee Hiscock is a director, and the membership and minutes secretary, whose husband, Stephen, recently served as British Consul-General in Brisbane and now serves as the high commissioner in Guyana. Julie Goodwin, at 15, is the youngest member. She has a glorious soprano voice, sings the anthem at all the events and composed the Palma Rosa theme. She sings at many major events throughout Queensland and indeed Australia. Trisha Anderson is a retired director who runs the magnificent Palma Rosa Poets, who, as I said before, hold regular performances on stage. Val Galwey plays the piano beautifully at every event held at Palma Rosa. Marlene Dickie has catered for numerous events voluntarily and free of charge. Venetia Stombuco, the only living relative bearing the name Stombuco, is of great assistance with activities within the Stombuco Room. Hilda Reid, Carmel Remphrey and Yvonne Hooper assist with debating and public speaking and have donated trophies. Brenton Campbell, only 19 years old, runs all public speaking and debating events. Bette Brown Smith, who recently and sadly passed away, formed the first ESU since 1963. Local councillor Tim Nicholls assists in every possible way with the ESU. I could keep going, because there are so many fine and distinguished Brisbane and Queensland citizens who provide such great service to that organisation.
 
Tomorrow, Patricia Johnson will fly off to London to help celebrate the 85th anniversary of the ESU. There is to be a service at Westminster Abbey on Thursday, 26 June 2003 and a luncheon afterwards at the headquarters of the ESU, Dartmouth House in Mayfair.

The Australian High Commissioner, Michael L'Estrange, will attend together with the ambassadors and high commissioners from all the countries where an ESU is established.

The Australian High Commissioner, Michael L'Estrange, will attend together with the ambassadors and high commissioners from all the countries where an ESU is established. Lord Watson from the House of Lords, as Chairman of the ESU, will host the event. I am sure that Patricia Johnson and her band of Queensland ESU members will represent us admirably and honourably with great distinction at this very fine function.  (Time expired)"

I first met Mike Hayes during the early 1980s. He was interested in the work that I was doing with rural adult literacy students. He provided copies of his prickle farmer stories for my classes and even recorded poetry for some of my students. He was interested in their situations and the challenges they faced, and he wove their problems into some of the prickle farmer stories. In 1990, as part of a project funded for International Literacy Year, Mike produced and starred in a promotional television advertisement for rural adult literacy classes. This, I have to say, was a challenging learning experience for me, working with someone of such creative talent who at the same time managed to create complete chaos around him. It took us quite a long time to shoot and finalise what was only a 30-second ad, but in the end it was a hugely effective campaign promoting enrolment in adult literacy classes."

Nobody wants war. It is a devastating activityâon the soldiers, on civilians, on world security. Nobody wants it. But every now and then, freedom and liberty are worth fighting forâindeed, worth dying forâbecause, if we do not fight, we become slaves. The history of our world has many wonderful examples of people who were willing to die for freedom and for the better of mankind. It may be appropriate to quote a poem which was on the  Sunrise  program this morning, and I will deal with some of the issues it raises. The poem "

John Jensen, who spoke at the ceremony, depicted Dyson as `an extraordinary figure who rose up, had this tremendous burst of vitality and intelligence and anger and compassion, all rolled up into one'. The new Dyson headstone was made at London's Lambeth College and carries an adapted Anzac symbol engraved with a pencil and a stem of wattle. Also engraved on Will and Ruby's headstone is a poem Dyson wrote at the time of Ruby's death:
 
A little land eternal, and mine own, where we forever go.
 
This grave would have remained unmarked and unrecognised if it were not for the efforts of a number of Will Dyson enthusiasts, lead by Mr Robin Ollington, and a number of donors, in particular Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. Dame Elisabeth recently told the  Herald Sun  how important she felt this project was. She said: 
 
I'm so glad the effort has been made to restore the gravestone and to perpetuate Will Dyson's memory. He was a very important and an impressive war artist.
 
I also believe that this has been a very important project. Will Dyson and his wife Ruby now rest in a marked grave. They surely deserve such respect and recognition."

(v) the reason we need to go back 100 years to now right this wrong, is because Breaker Morant is one of the fathers of our ANZAC tradition; a friend of Banjo Patterson and an inspiration for much of his poetry and described as a man of great courage who would never betray a mate; and a man of whom many of the young ANZACs in World War I had heard and on whom they modelled themselves."

âThat is not in my portfolio but certainly the government has supported education programs in relation to alcohol and acknowledges that alcohol is a problem we have to deal with in our community. We funded the alcohol research foundation in relation to both research and education, as I understand it. I will take on notice the question about advertising.
 
While I am on my feet, I cannot let go unchecked a couple of comments that were made by Senator Brown and one aspect that Senator Greig mentioned. I am not aware of the Commissioner of Police ever saying that the reduction in heroin was due to a heroin drought in South-East Asia. I am aware that the Police Commissioner, Mick Keelty, said that the reduction in supply was largely due to law enforcement measures and interdiction. You can get droughts from time to time or reductions in production from time to time in Afghanistan and the Golden Triangle but criminals are not stupid. They build up stockpiles which keep the flow going. We saw that in relation to Afghanistan and the Taliban. It cut back production for a while but there were huge stockpiles that kept those supplies going. As we know, heroin goes from Afghanistan largely to Europe and the United States, and we get our supply of heroin from the Golden Triangle. But I can state with confidence that the Police Commissioner of the AFP, Mick Keelty, has always stated that the major reason for the reduction in supply has been the interdiction by law enforcement. I believe that that has been borne out by independent assessment.
 
In relation to Senator Brown's comments, I think it is a bit rich of Senator Brown to come in here and attack the government's policy in relation to drugs. Firstly, Senator Brown was not in the chamber when I detailed the support that this government gave to diversionary programs. I cited the example of a program that I knew about personally in the Drug Court in Western Australia. That is not law enforcement only; that is rehabilitation. We introduced a national schools drug education strategy. I introduced that strategy when I was minister for schools in 1998. That is not law enforcement; it is a wider approach in the fight against drugs. I appreciate the acknowledgment that Senator Greig gave to that but in response to Senator Brown's comments I would say that his comment that there is just a law enforcement approach to drugs from this government is totally wrong. We have spent over a billion dollars on the Tough on Drugs strategy. As I recall, the majority of that funding of over a billion dollars would have been spent on education and health.
 
Recently, I announced just over $2 million from the proceeds of crimeâthere is some poetic justice, you might say, in relation to those proceedsâgoing to drug rehabilitation programs. That money went to drug rehabilitation. That is not law enforcement; that is drug rehabilitation. We have always said that we fight drugs on three fronts: law enforcement, education and rehabilitation. You will not find me saying anything else nor have I deviated from that since I have been in this role or in my previous roles as minister for schools or parliamentary secretary to the minister for health.

âSenator Ian Campbell, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, has replied not only in question time but also in this take note of answers debate succinctly to Senator Mackay's question. He has said that there is no so-called secret agenda to stop funding of family planning services. He went on to say that this is the beat-up of the week, and it is only Monday. Those opposite are at it again. On International Women's Day you would think they could come into this parliament and celebrate the occasion with a bit more generosity. But, no, they come in here with their usual beat-up with regard to family planning, which is hardly the broader issue of International Women's Day. There are so many other subjects involved which they do not raise or celebrate. They come in here with a typically negative and nasty approach to all issues. This is a time to raise many issues, and I thought they would have taken the opportunity to do so. 
 
The minister, nevertheless, in his generosity has given you a succinct, direct and committed reply, but you reject it out of hand. Of course, you have to. You think it is your job to and so you do. Today is an opportunity to recognise International Women's Day in another way. I, as a National Party senator from Victoria, take the opportunity to recognise International Women's Day by remembering the women of the bush, the women in rural and regional areas throughout Australia. First of all, I take this opportunity to remember the pioneering women, who were the backbone of those early settlers and families in times of drought, flood and hardship. There were hard times, as we know only too well from the poetry and legends that are told of those times, and we know how important a role women played.
 
Today, it is no different. Women from the country areas, the isolated areas, particularly in my colleague Senator Lightfoot's state of Western Australiaâmore so than in Victoriaâand outback stations still play the same role. They are the sisters of the old pioneers. In times of drought or flood they are the backbone of the family. But perhaps there is a new dimension to the times of the pioneering women; today's women are now taking greater care in the finances of the farms. They seem to have taken up that role in times of financial hardship, particularly during the years when interest rates were soaring. It was the women who held the family together emotionally and were able to understand the finances when many farmers did not. More than ever we should recognise the role women played in the country during that period.
 
Of course, I am not just talking about women on the farms but also about women in the small towns and their volunteer efforts with the CFAâthe fire brigadesâwith all the charity groups and, of course, those women in small business. I could go on. That group should be recognised on this day. I hope that Senator Stott Despoja, who is a great advocate for women, and Senator Denman, who has just entered the chamber, would jump up on International Women's Day and raise subjects like that. They should have a bit of outlook. They should not come in here with negative beat-ups just to take a political opportunity on such a day. Also, we know only too well the opportunities within politics. Those women I have just pointed outâSenator Denman and Senator Stott  Despojaâand Senator Stephensâ"

âI rise this evening to mark the passing of Professor Brian Medlin, a great South Australian who died on 27 October this year. Professor Medlin will be remembered by many South Australians for his very public leadership of the campaign to stop the war in Vietnam. For many, the enduring image of Brian is as the long-haired professor of philosophy, spreadeagled between two policemen and dragged from the front of the anti-Vietnam War march in September 1970. Along with many others, Brian Medlin was arrested that day and, after a trial that was widely condemned for its distorted, incoherent and contradictory testimony, he was imprisoned. He was released three weeks later but his incarceration was noted publicly and, indeed, supporters kept a candlelight vigil outside the Adelaide jail. Few of us are ever called upon to go to jail for our beliefs. However, as public as his own contribution to the antiwar movement was, throughout his life Brian Medlin continued to insist that there were many campaigners who did much more than he did, and that in itself tells us a lot about the man. 
 
Brian Medlin was born in 1927 in Orroroo in the mid-north of South Australia. He grew up in Adelaide, attending Richmond primary and Adelaide technical high school. While at secondary school in Adelaide, the Adelaide poet Flexmore Hudson introduced young Medlin to the work of Bertrand Russell and thus set him on his life's course. After graduating from Adelaide tech in the mid-1940s, Medlin took a position as a storekeeper on the Victoria River Downs station. Already a prodigious reader, the 18-year-old spent his time reading the books he would be sent up regularly from Mary Martin's bookshop. Staying on in the Territory after resigning from Victoria River Downs, Brian Medlin was variously a kangaroo shooter, a stockyard builder, a horse breaker and a drover with his own plant. Once, at the request of a boss drover Matt Savage, Medlin took a mob of 60 horses across the Tanami to the Western Australian coast accompanied only by Savage's 12-year-old daughter and her uncle. He was immensely proud of his time and his achievements in the Territory. Indeed, they marked him for life."

Returning to Adelaide in the 1950s, Medlin worked as a clerk for Ansett Airways and as a teacher at Adelaide tech. Meanwhile, he enrolled at Adelaide University to study English, Latin and philosophy. At this time he became increasingly active in the cultural and literary life of Adelaide. He wrote poetry and he moved in Adelaide's literary circles, which included the likes of John Bray, Mary Martin, Charles Jury, Max Harris, Douglas Muecke and Michael Taylor. Brian Medlin's intellect and capacity for comprehension were reflected in his academic results. He graduated with first-class honours in 1958, having established himself as a brilliant philosopher of great promise."

My dad, who was actually a Queensland droverâand there are not many of those left anymoreâdid not have a lot of formal education but, thanks to the educational processes of the time, he could quote whole streams of Australian poetry. That was the way people were taught at that time. He was able to burst into whole streams of Lawson and Paterson. That kind of ownership is something that I think we should be encouraging in our kidsânot that I think they all have to have the ability to quote streams of poetry. I am talking about that sense of identityâthe sense that our stories can be shared; that we have something of value that we own and of which we are proud. 
 
I would like to end with a quote from a Queensland artist, who has also been extremely successful overseas, particularly in the American context. He is a country singer from Queensland called Graeme Connors."

I have spoken to a number of people about this. Some people say, âYou can go up there anywayâwhat difference does it make if you catch the lift rather than walk?â Other people talk about the absolute fundamental symbolic importance of people being able to simply walk openly up from outside onto the top of the roof. You could say that all this talk of symbolism is just people getting a bit carried away with poetry and that we have to talk about pure functionality. That is one attitude. On the other hand, you could say that this is a significant, potentially permanent change to the whole symbolism and perception of our Parliament House. By way of examples, I recommend that people read Margo Kingstonâs new book. It is an interesting read overall, but there is a section with a couple of peopleâs perspectivesâthis book has other peopleâs views, not just the authorâsâabout access to Parliament House. One section is written by somebody who talks about the importance and the eternal symbolism that âin a democracy the people stand above their elected representativesâ. Some might think that is just flowery language of no great significance. Others might say it is of fundamental importance. I think we could ask people those sorts of questionsâhow important it is and how much they are willing to pay."
