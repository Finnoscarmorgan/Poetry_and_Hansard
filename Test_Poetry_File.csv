-  Senator Symon,  when he addressed the Chamber yesterday, commenced with what, I think, I may describe as an inverted quotation. If I wanted to follow his illustrious example, I think I should commence my few remarks this afternoon by submitting, without any personal reference to any member of the Chamber, a very oldfashioned conundrum. That conundrum is - "" Why is a lawyer like a restless sleeper,"" to which the answer is - "" Because he lies on one side, and then turns and lies on the other.""

Senator Symon  occupied about three hours yesterday afternoon in demolishing an hypothesis which he most emphatically insisted upon three weeks ago. I can understand a lawyer doing that sort of thing in connexion with the practice of his profession ; we know that lawyers are briefed, and have duties to discharge, and when they are brought, as they sometimes are, into juxtaposition with awkward circumstances in their professional work, they are necessarily allowed some liberty. 
 
But when it comes to arguing a question in. this Chamber, I think that the same degree of liberty is not necessary, and certainly in my view is not desirable.  Senator Glassey's  amendment has been the subject of much discussion and trouble in this Chamber and elsewhere ; indeed one might quote Lord Macaulay -
