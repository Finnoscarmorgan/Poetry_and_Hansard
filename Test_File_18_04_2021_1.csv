91,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3790,0,1327,"NEILD, John",JXT,MINISTERS IN THE SENATE,Questions,New South Wales,,,0,0,"That this Senate records its disapprobation of the action of the Prime Minister in failing, when reconstructing the Cabinet, togive effect to the resolution of the Senate, unanimously adopted on the 26th day of June last, viz: - ""That this Senate affirms that, in view of the position and status of this branch of the Legislature, as defined by and in the Constitution, it is desirable that there be more adequate representation of the Government in the Senate by the appointment of at least two paid Ministers."" "
92,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3790,0,1327,"NEILD, John",JXT,MINISTERS IN THE SENATE,Questions,New South Wales,,,0,0,"The form of the motion seems to me almost sufficiently plain to render needless any lengthy remarks on my part. On the 26th June, the Senate unanimously - the Minister present concurring - passed the resolution embodied in my motion. An opportunity recently occurred for givingeffect to this claim, based, not so much on, I imagine, the personal ambition of any honorable senator as on a desire to giveexpression to the view of the Senate, that there should be more adequate representation of the Government here, involving and permitting the introduction of a larger number of measures directly rather than at second-hand. Itwill be in the recollection of honorable senators that the motion in its original form, submitted in its second part a proposition that it was desirable that more measures of the Government should be introduced directly in the Senate. During the course of the debate I withdrew that portion of the motion, deeming that it was not necessary to go to the vote. But this seems to me to be a suitable opportunity to refer to the fact that my action on the 26th June was taken with the object of getting more measures of the Government initiated here. That would be accomplished unquestionably if a larger number of Ministers, having charge ofDepartments, were in the Chamber. Recently there was a certain amount of Cabinet-repairing, and the opportunity was given to the Prime Minister to give effect to the unanimous wish of the Senate. So far as we know, no inclination has been manifested to give effect to its resolution, and we only hear now from the lips of an honorable senator that he is to take up the position of an unpaid Minister here before very long. How soon we do not know, but, as the honorable senator has pleaded guilty to the gentle indictment, I suppose there cannot be any doubt about it. That being the case, we find that not only in the past has the resolution of the Senate been ignored by the Prime Minister, but that he is still proposing to ignore it by the appointment of an unpaid Minister here, rather than a salaried Minister having charge of a Department. I disclaim all desire now to do more than afford to the Senate an opportunity of confirming the action which it took at my instance a few weeks ago. It appeared to me then, and it appears to me still, that if we were to allow the matter to pass without any comment or explanation we should be absolutely stultifying ourselves. Deliberately, after considerable argument, we arrived at a resolution to make a certain demand ; opportunity for giving effect to the wish of the Senate arose ; but no such effect was given, and as far as we know it was not attempted to be given. I consider that it is my duty to afford an opportunity to the Senate of indorsing its previous vote, or an opportunity for an explanation to be offered which would satisfy the Senate that its deliberate resolution has not beenas deliberately ignored. I shall not go into the question of who might have been appointed, or what might have been done, but I consider that the Senate was entitled to at least an explanation as to why nothing was done to give effect to its unanimous decision on a question of large public importance, arrived at, not in a light or airy manner, not without due consideration, but with all the impressiveness which attaches to a carefully considered and deliberately debated proposition.

In dealing with such questions it is essential to keep in view the conditions as they present themselves to the enemy, as the extent of the protection required at any port is evidently that which will increase the risks involved in an attack to a point at which they will outweigh in the opinion of an enemy the possible advantages to be derived from the enterprise.

This is the case where valuable and vulnerable resources such as docks, naval stores, or large masses of shipping are collected within such a limited and exposed space that they are liable to be easily destroyed by the gun-fire of hostile cruisers with a small expenditure of ammunition. The object of fixed defences is to deter the enemy's vessels from approaching within the range at which his fire would be effective :a such objects. As already pointed out, the measure of defence required will vary according to the advantages to be derived by the enemy from the particular attack con templated. Thus  naval bases or mercantile strategic harbors in the neighbourhood of points where the routes followed by Australian floating trade converge would offer more inducement to attack than a commercial port where only a small amount of shipping might be lying of value incommensurate with the risks involved in coming under the fire of light fixed defences or even of troops on shore.

180,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3798,0,1327,"PEARCE, George",K0F,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"- What I am pointing out is that in any case the war would be likely to be localized. Suppose that the cause of dispute were the holding of territory in China or the partitioning of China, surely the war would  be centralized very largely in conquering or holding the territories in dispute ? I have pointed -out that the idea of the partition or the conquest of Australia is ridiculous. First, the internal jealousies of European nations would keep that from becoming a realized fact, and further it would not be to the interests of the United States to see Australia pass into the hands of any European power, and its policy of aggrandizement has not developed to such an extent as to suggest that it would attempt to make Australia an American possession. Seeing that the Commonwealth is so young, it is not reasonable, I submit, to ask us yet to take that part in the burdens of Empire which may involve us in a policy of aggrandizement. Will the annual payment of £200,000 help the Empire to any appreciable extent when it is spent  on the up-keep of warships which are not intended for Australia's defence? On the other hand, the judicious expenditure ofl the money on the building of am Australian fleet, which would make Australia safe from foreign attack, if that is possible, would relieve the Empire to a considerable extent.

I would rather support a proposal, such as that which was made by the Government of Cape Colony when they proposed to build and equip' a warship for presentation to the British Navy. That is a much more patriotic proposal than the present one, which assumes the form of a tribute to a power outside Australia.

For instance, if, as the Government and their supporters claim, the safety of Australia will depend most likely on a naval battle to be .fought hundreds, perhaps thousands of miles away from Australia, what will become of the boast of British naval supremacy if it has to depend on an annual subsidy of £200,000 from Australia ? Because it is put to us that if we do not pass this Bill we shall vote against the naval supremacy of the Empire, against that policy which demands that the naval authorities shall be able to concentrate their fleets in any part of the world. That policy will be just as tenable if the Bill be rejected as if it be accepted. It does not depend upon our acceptance or our rejection of the Bill. We can acquiesce in that as a question of strategy, and yet say that, for the defence of our Inter-State commerce and of our ports, it is advisable that whatever money we have to spare should be devoted to the establishment of an Australian Navy.

I desire to interpret the honorable senator fairly, and if that is his contention I join issue with him at once. It may be contended that because we can grow all the bread-stuffs and raise all the meat we require here, our commerce would not be seriously injured, but what would become of our great exports of wool and minerals ?

The advantage of central control is that in an instant, or, at any rate, as rapidly as communication cau be despatched from one part of the world to another, it is possible to mass a superior force against an enemy at a given point. That cannot be done if there is tied to these shores a squadron quite unable to cope with a big or superior naval force, but which would be able to render useful and, it may be, greatly needed assistance if sent to join hands with any other portion of the British Navy. I think we might draw something of a parallel from the arguments used in urging the adoption of Australian Federation. It was pointed out then that each of the States with its little army would be an easy prey to any invading force, but that the capacity in military matters of two men is more than twice that of one man - that by joining hands it would be possible to,mass all the troops at a certain point, and so make our defences effective. The same principle underlies the proposition that there ought to be central control in naval matters. The sea is a broad thoroughfare along which all may pass - unlike land warfare the enemy on the sea may be anywhere. For that reason, it is necessary to have central control, in order to meet an ever-changing front, and to repeat the words I previously used - to be able to mass a superior force at any point where the enemy may be present. That is necessary in order to secure an advantage which I contend is obtainable only  under central  control. That is the proposition and principle maintained by every writer that I have had an opportunity of reading. "

The Vice-President of the Executive Council stated that if we had a fleet of our own, men would have to be brought from England.

I quite admit that no amount of talking will affect the vote ; but I am speaking because I desire to show why I am not in favour of the proposed subsidy, and why I should like to see an Australian Navy established. The estimated cost of the new fleet is £480,000. I am sure that the people of Australia would not begrudge paying £300,000 per annum- that is £100,000 per annum more than we are asked to pay - to secure a fleet of their own. Captain Creswell showed us how we could obtain a fleet by such means. He does not say that it would be an efficient defence for Australia in the first year or two, but for every ship of our own which we purchased the British Governmentcould remove one of theirs, and that process could be continued until we had a fleet sufficiently strong for our purposes. We have heard a. great deal about what has been said by various authorities, but there is one authority who has not been mentioned to whom we should pay a little attention. That is the late Admiral Tryon, who is said by some to- have understood the question of Australian defence better than any other expert who has ever been in these waters. Admiral Tryon was in favour of the establishment of an Australian Navy. It was on his advice that the  Auxilary  Squadron was established. He expressed his views in favour of a development of that kind over and over again. He says in his letter to Governor Loch upon this question - "

349,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3809,0,1327,"CAMERON, Cyril",K3S,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,".- I had not read the whole of the agreement; but I will deal with that point as I proceed. The first thing that strikes my attention in the agreement is this : In the schedule it is set forth, first of all, that it is necessary to have a single navy, under one authority, to insure concerted action ; and, secondly, there are set forth the advantages to be derived from developing the sea power of Australia and New Zealand. Those are the two main principles contained in the schedule. The first - the necessity for a single navy under one control to insure concerted action - is almost a truism. It must be patent to every one that a navy under a single authority would be far more effective, and, other things being equal, more successful, than a series of small units operating separately. In fact, if I may use another truism to explain my view, the successful general, or successful commander, is he who can heat his enemy in detail ; that is to say, who can concentrate upon a series of weak points; and generally roll up his adversary. That is the great principle which is applicable not only to operations on land, but by water also. There is a point that I should like to emphasize before going any further. It is this : There is nothing inconsistent in the proposal that we should have an Australian Navy, manned and controlled entirely in Australia, with all the morale and all the advantages that would attach to a local force, and the broad principle that in time of war every State in the Empire having the control of its local forces should place them voluntarily and without question underonesupremehead, whoever he might be. It might be the Admiralty in England, or in the future it might be the Admiraltyin Australia. The second point to which I desire to call attention is the advantage to be derived from the development of the sea power of Australia. That is recognised. Will the agreement carry out what we desire? Speaking: without hesitation or reservation, I very much doubt if it will. The whole point of this agreement is the aim of the Admiralty to raise an Australian force as a supplement to what I may call for the moment the British Navy. Will any one believe that the annual contribution of £200,000 is an important consideration with the Admiralty ? The whole question with the Admiralty is the raising of a naval force of Australians in these States. That is the point round which the interests of the British Government centre, and which no one seems, as yet to have touched. "

351,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3810,0,1327,"CAMERON, Cyril",K3S,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"- I have not seen it.. That is the point on which  I  join issue with the agreement ; although I am prepared to support its adoption for reasons which I shall state by-and-by. To my mind, the blot on the agreement is that it will be the means of raising, in our midst, or, at all events, of ear-marking, anumber of men who will be trained without acquiring those qualities which go to create an interest in local surroundings - with feelings foreign to Australia. It may be said that later on these men would form the nucleus of an Australian Navy if we should decide to make a departure and to establish it. That might be so, but there must be a beginning. Why should we not make it ourselves ?. Are we effete ?

I doubt whether the naval authorities will succeed in raising a force here. We ought not to calculate upon that possibility. We ought to take the agreement as it is, and to be prepared loyally to support its provisions for a limited term. We should not hide ourselves behind the possibility of saying- "" Here is a contribution of £200,000, but we shall not let you have the men. We shall put every obstacle in the way of your getting them."" If we accept the agreement we ought to do all in our power to carry out its spirit. The foundation of patriotism is laid in our homes, and radiates to the farthest limits of the Empire. Let it be clearly understood that the agreement is only of a temporary nature ; and that on the expiration of the ten years we shall undertake the formation of a Davy, and accept the duties and responsibilities of our local naval defence. Unless we take that course, we shall have the naval authorities raising up in Australia a force with sympathies foreign to local institutions, and to our own people. What benefit would accrue to the Empire if the navy were off the shores of Europe, or in the Eastern seas, and we were without any protection ?

But it does seem to me that it will be a very sorry preparation for that destiny, and a still sorrier preparation for a future of harmony with the motherland, that we should enter into such an agreement as this or that we should assent to this Bill.

I think my honorable friend "

When my .honorable and learned friends opposite try absolutely to separate things which are inseparable, I believe it to be my duty to point out the mistake they make. When our ships containing our wool, our fruit, our butter, and our minerals, get to the other  end of the world, is it to be said that Australian trade ceases ? We have to get paid for our produce, and we receive payment in the form of shipments of machinery, -groceries, apparel, and goods of every description. Indeed, I am not at all certain that Australian trade ceases until we actually get back the shipments in return for the goods which we have sent to Europe. How, then, is it possible to draw these distinctions? It appears to me that the whole question is governed by the fact that there is one sea. It is impossible to divide the sea. For purposes of convenience we call parts of it by different names, but the ocean is one. There is one Empire, there is one trade, and there ought to be and must be one Imperial Navy. We may have an Australian branch of it - I hope we shall; we may have a Canadian and a Natal branch. But it must be one federated Imperial Navy ; and unless we have that, we cannot have a perfect system of defence, nor a perfect system of protection. With regard to the question of trade, I should like to read these remarks from the memorandum of the First Lord of the Admiralty, which was laid before the Colonial Conference in London - "
572,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3825,0,1327,"DOBSON, Henry",JVC,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"In the year 1900, the sea-borne trade of  the Empire  may be roughly stated to have been worth between eleven and twelve hundred millions sterling ; but of this vast sum, a proportion of certainly not less than one-fourth was trade in which the taxpayer of the United Kingdom had no interest, either as buyer or seller, of the particular goods represented by these values. It was either intercolonial trade or trade between 'the British -dominions beyond the seas and foreign countries. The taxpayer of the United Kingdom has therefore the privilege not only of taking upon himself the lion's share of the burden, the interest in which is shared between himself and his fellow subjects in the dominions beyond the seas, but also a not less share of the burden in respect of interests which are not his own, in respect of but exclusively those of his fellow subjects beyond the seas.

575,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3825,0,1327,"DOBSON, Henry",JVC,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"- If, as the honorable senator would say, one white man is equal to fifty black men, he himself is more capable, of answering that question than I am. Does he consider that the unfortunate 280,000,000 black people, who earn hardly enough to live upon, should be included as taxpayers ? If we include the military expenditure, we find that the people in the United Kingdom pay 29s. 3d. per head, whereas, before Federation the people of Victoria paid 3s. '3d., the people of New South Wales 3s. 5d., and those of New Zealand 3s. 4d. So that I think it must be apparent that the Commonwealth of Australia is not paying its fair share towards the defence of that portion of the trade of the Empire which is undoubtedly hers, and in which she has the greatest interest. I find that some authorities estimate our trade at about £114,000,000. Of this our trade with Great Britain amounts to £50,500,000, our trade with British possessions to £11,500,000, with foreign nations £25,000,000, and our trade between States to £27,000,000. Here is an enormous trade which has to be protected, and the protection of which has to be provided for over the whole 12,000 miles - or whatever the distance may be - which divide the places of export in the Commonwealth from the places of import that receive our produce. Any Australian Navy which we can ever hope to have, can never take the place of that portion of the Imperial Navy which defends our coasts arid ports. "

I venture to think that the lascars, whom my honorable friends think not good enough to carry their mails, will one day, not far distant, be found in British ships, and probably fighting our battles, while they are comfortably enjoying themselves on the morocco benches yonder. May I ask my honorable friends a question ? When a war came, would not a victory or a defeat practically decide everything? If the command of the seas were lost, I take it that Australia would, to some extent, fall with the Empire. On the other hand, I take it that, if the battle were won, it would matter very little to us whether two or three million pounds worth of property in this port or two or three million pounds worth of property in another' port had been blown to pieces or taken out of the bank, because, as .victor, Great Britain would see that the aggressor recouped us the whole of our losses. So that everything comes back to the question of whether in a maritime war Great Britain would win or loose. I cannot mix up that large question with the pettifogging question of whether we are bound to have a 1 vessel ready to meet every raiding cruiser that might happen to come here. The chances are that if a raiding cruiser were smart she might destroy some of our ports, even if we had that Australian Navy which my honorable friends want controlled by the Government under an Australian Admiral. While we might lose halfadozen little battles between a local fort and a raiding cruiser, we might be winning elsewhere a battle which would determine for the next quarter of a century whether England should or should not remain mistress of the seas. . In trying to localize this question of defence and cutting ourselves off from the navy and the trade of the Empire, I find myself unable to follow the arguments that have come from my honorable  freinds.  I am utterly unable to conceive how we could ever have a navy,, floating batteries, or armed cruisers ready to meet every cruiser which might once in a blue moon chance to attack Melbourne, Brisbane, Hobart, or any other port. We must run that risk, and a very small one it is. Why "

616,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3828,0,1327,"DOBSON, Henry",JVC,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"- That argument cutsagainst my honorable friends. What is the use of having an Australian Navy which would be chained to the rocks outside, which would never go beyond Australian waters? I made a note to ask my honorable friends what would become of New Guinea and the New Hebrides if we should ever get intotrouble. What would become of Australia if we should get into a disturbance in the South Pacific ? Should we not want our navy free to go instantly to the scene of the trouble ? Is it not one hundred chances to« one that it would be sent there rather than be left to hug the Australian coast ? The argument tells against my honorable friend. Again I venture to assert that there is no proper base within 4,000 miles of Melbourne which would be likely to be used by any nation 'with which we might be at war. I do not think there would be much chance of anything but a stray cruiser coming down to raid our cities* and, if one did come, she would act like a pirate, making up her mind that the chances would be ten to. one that she would lose. If she did gain, the men would, perhaps, obtain great kudos and get their pockets well lined. But the chances, are ten to one that she would fail. We know that these desperate undertakings are sometimes entered upon, but I do not think that we need bother, ourselves much on that score. Then, with regard to the question of officers,, the agreement provides that cadetships may be started at once.- The cadets might in due course rise to the highest command in the navy. A cadet who as a lad entered! the Australian Navy might be transferred to the Imperial branch, and come out by-and-by as the Admiral of our fleet. So that, in every way, the agreement does promote and encourage the aspirations which we all have. I have one more quotation from Lord Selborne to read before I .resume my seat. He says - "

I fancy that the members of the Senate have made up their minds as to how their votes will be cast, and the chief object I have in speaking is to give a brief statement of the reasons for the vote I shall give. I do not propose to attempt any proselytising, but merely to state the reasons for my vote, and I shall be content to do so very briefly. To begin with, I am absolutely in favour of an Australian navy. Butwhen I find that the ruling party in another place, the party that would rule here if possible, has absolutely refused to allow money to be borrowed for the purposes of the Commonwealth, I fail to see how it is possible to find funds from revenue, to the extent of even £2,000,000, which would be about the smallest cost of any adequate naval force including ships, armament, stores, and all the etceteras which go to make up a squadron, let alone a fleet. "
626,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3830,0,1327,"WALKER, James",KAH,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,=- we could not do it for the money.
627,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3830,0,1327,"NEILD, John",JXT,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"- I am suggesting the smallest possible sum. I do not know where £2,000,000, let alone a much larger sum, is to come from. In speaking of the sum which would be required I, of course, can only give an opinion formed from reading the official reports of men who do know something about the subject. There is no member of the Senate who can speak of his own personal knowledge as to the necessary expense. We can speak only as we have gained information at the hands or lips of those who are competent to give an authoritative statement. To begin with, I do not know where the money is comingfrom toexpend on a  navy of our own at present. When the time comes, no doubt the moneywill be borrowed, and we shall have our own fleet. I have written in favour of a Commonwealth Squadron, and I am prepared to advocate a Commonwealth Squadron if I see any chance, of getting it, and if I see any chance of its being under proper management when we have got it. What I specially draw attention to, and what I wish specially to emphasize, is this : that, as one of those charged with a public trust in connexion, with the Commonwealth, I am not at present disposed, and am never likely to be. disposed, to place the management in detail of the naval defence of the Commonwealth in the grasp of those who for the last two years have been doing their utmost, and doing it successfully, to destroy our land forces. If the same persons as those who have destroyed our land forces are to have the management of our naval forces in detail, then God help Australia ! If the Australian Squadron is tobe made subject to such a preposterous mangling as the Defence Force of the Commonwealth has had to endure for the last two years or so, then I again say God help the Commonwealth ! One other observation occurs to me in connexion with this question of expense, and as a reason why we should seek to embrace the favorable terms which are offered to us. I suppose that in some form or another we are all customers of, or connected in some way with, insurance companies. I daresay that every honorable senator present possesses either a life or fire assurance policy in a colonial office. It sometimes happens that those who are most enthusiastic supporters of colonial institutions cannot obtain the full extent of cover or protection they require from colonial offices. What do they do under those circumstances? No matter how enthusiastic they may be as supporters of colonial institutions they pay their money to a larger, longer established, and more extensively funded English office. But do they consider that payment as a tribute ? I find people using the term ""naval tribute"" as applied to this agreement, but will honorable senators say that the premium paid for fire,life, or marine assurance to a British office is a tribute? The payment is made in order to secure the protection or ""cover"" desired. "

I ask those honorable senators who believe that Australia can only be properly defended by keeping a naval force at home to look through English history, or the history of any nation that has had to do with a maritime force. Where were the naval battles of England fought? Where they all fought in the English Channel ? Were they not all fought off foreign coasts ever since the days of the Armada. Have not the great majority of the great naval battles of England been fought off foreign coasts ? Did Nelson stop in the Channell when he desired to destroy the fleet of Napoleon ?' Did he not plough the waters of almost every corner of the Mediterannean back and forth until, on the shores of Egypt, hean nihilated the them naval power ofFrance? What about the expeditions that sailed every year and every six months attimes of acti ve conflict to the East and West Indies , wheresome of England's greatest naval fights have taken place ? What about the fleets that have sailed the Atlantic ? What about the fights that have taken place off the coastsof Spainand Portugal ? All these events plainly show that the object to be achieved in naval warfare is the same as in land warfare - to concentrate and to crush. The whole business is summed up in those two words. We must concentrate and crush the enemy ; we must not wait until the enemy has concentrated and crushed us in detail. We must take time by the forelock, and concentrate our forces in order to crush our enemy. "

I was not in favour of renewing the old agreement, because I do not think that its conditions are nearly so favorable as those now presented. The new agreement gives us that mode of naval protection which appears necessary in the estimation of the experts of the Empire, and it is given without compelling us to make any outlay of a capital kind. We are only asked to give a contribution ; and here I may say that I regard the word ""tribute"" as an insult alike to the Commonwealth and the mother country. ""Tribute"" implies a recognition of inferiority, and the Commonwealth owes no obligation of inferiority to the mother country, nor does the mother country demean herself by imposing such a condition on her children. The proposed agreement, as I say, without the outlay of a . heavy capital, gives not only the immediate advantage of naval protection, but also an opportunity,, which we in Australia have never possessed before, of securing ah adequate training for our sons. An opening is., here presented for our stalwart men and 'the young chaps who are growing up and are. anxious to take their place in the defence forces, not only of the Commonwealth, but of the Empire. . The heart of the Commonwealth beats true enough torecognise that in unity with the rest of the greatest Empire upon which the sun has ever shone there, are advantages to be gained. The conditions of the mutual exchange of support are honorable and beneficent - they are advantageous to the buyer and advantageous to the seller. There are the advantages which flow from an honest and honorable understanding, and from a mutual effort to secure the greatest good of both he who gives and he who takes. "

652,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3833,0,1327,"WALKER, James",KAH,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"The article goes on to provide that the ships shall be officered by officers of the Royal Navy, supplemented by officers of the Royal Naval Reserve. Article 6 provides for eight annual nominations for naval cadetships to be given to Australia, and two to Ne\y Zealand. It is within the knowledge of many honorable senators that this by no means represents all the Australian naval cadets who enter the British service yearly. I know one bank manager in Queensland who has a son a major in the army, and another a lieutenant in the navy, these young men having gone home in order to join the services. There is a considerable contingent of Australian officers in the navy now ; and the more there are the better we shall be pleased. We are extremely indebted to the Imperial authorities for the protection of our mercantile marine. We must not judge our commerce by the exports from Australia to Great Britain, or by the imports from the old country ; we must recognise that the confidence given by the protection of the British Navy enables our ships to go to all parts of the world. At  the end of ten years we shall be more free than we are at present to spend money on naval defence. For the first ten years of the Commonwealth we are under the "" Braddon "" section of the Constitution, and the expenditure of the Commonwealth  is limited ; but at the end of that period, if we wish to be more extravagant in the way of naval expenditure, we shall have the opportunity. At present, however, we cannot afford more than we are asked to pay under the agreement. As to descents by privateers in the absence of the fleet, I take it that in these days of cable communication the home authorities will know very well from whence and when such descents are likely to be made ; at any rate they will be better informed on those points than we can be. The navy is not localized at home, but at the same time every vulnerable point is well protected. About 100 years ago there used to be Martello Towers along the coasts of Great Britain.

I am not one who believes, or affects to believe, that Australia is in serious danger of invasion, and that she requires a large and powerful fleet - that a descent is likely to be made on her by any European Power. The ""United States are between 3,000 and 4,000 miles from Europe, and that country, so far as I remember, has never been attacked by any Power except that whose colony she once was. The only occasion, I think, on which the people of the United States have hud to meet a foreign foe was when Britain invaded her. The other European Powers, although within comparatively easy striking distance, never made the slightest demonstration against the United States. We are, in my opinion, much safer than even the United States was, seeing that we are separated from Europe by about 16,000 miles of sea. One honorable senator told us that the nearest naval base to Australia was 4,000 miles distant. Ho urged that  our coasts  would be exposed to the ravages of cruisers if the British fleet were taken away, but at the same time he tried to show that there was very little fear of foreign vessels coming to Australian coasts. He argued one way when it suited him, but he argued exactly the opposite way when that aspect of the case served his purpose.  It  has been said that the centre of danger in the event of a great war would not be near to us, but somewhere far distant from our shores.' In considering ""this question. I ask myself what should we do if we were an independent community. I know that the idea of Australia ever separating herself from the mother country is repugnant to the minds of many of our citizens. I sympathize with them. But in the ordinary course of events, one day Australia will be separated. She will "" set up house"" for herself in every particular. Instead of this Commonwealth being injured by a state of severance - instead of Great Britain being injured by it - I believe that it would be better for both. There would be a friendly alliance between the two countries. There would not be dependence on the one hand and charity on ti le other - for that is practically what the present situation amounts to. Those honorable senators who care to look back into the pages of history can read about the crisis which resulted in the great American war - how the governing classes of Great Britain prophesied the ruin of England if the United States were not firmly bound to her chariot wheels.

663,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3835,0,1327,"STEWART, James",K7D,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"- I suppose that would be said. Supposing that Lord Howard of Effingham, who was the High Admiral of the British fleet, hearing that Spain intended to make this attack, had said - "" We will go down to the coasts of Spain and beat the Spanish fleet on its own shores,"" does any oneimagine that England would have come so triumphantly out of that contest as she did? I do not think so. My view is that her fleet would have been annihilated, that Spain would have become absolute mistress of the seas, and that England's prestige and position would have had a set back for 100 years at least. I will take another instance - not a naval one this time. It is the case of a great general, who conceived the idea of beating his enemy on that enemy's own ground. Napoleon took it into his head that he would bait the Russian bear in his lair. He tried to do so. He marched into Russia. He encountered the snows and frosts of that inhospitable region, and was met by the fires of Moscow. Instead of defeating his enemy, he came back a broken and defeated man. I am not one of those who believe that if I have a quarrel with a man, or imagine that I have reason to dispute with him, it is my business to go and search him out wherever he may be. I think that would be a waste of energy. I prefer to let him do the travelling, and conserve my energy until he comes before me and squares up. Then I am ready to engage in combat with him. The question of insurance has been referred to by some speakers. It is said that the amount we are paying is merely insurance money. But whose are the ships which carry all the produce from our shores, and bring goods from England? Has Great Britain no interest in Australia? I believe that she has something like £400,000,000 sterling invested here. She receives an annual tribute of something like £15,000,000 from us. Does any one imagine that the bond-holders in Great Britain are going to allow anything to happen to Australia so long as their interest or their stake in the country is so large? In Great Britain's own interest, for her own sake, and for the sake of her subjects, she must protect her own commerce, and, by so doing, protect Australian interests. "

Our first duty is to pay attention to the development of this great continent of over 3,000,000 square miles, and not to be diverted from that great purpose by the prospect of any considerable traffic on the sea. Take the case of the United States. Have its people troubled about a navy? Why, they did not begin to establish a navy until very lately, and a very large proportion of the population was, opposed to the new departure. Does any one imagine that the people of that country would have been so prosperous, would have achieved such a high state of industrial efficiency, would have reached their present social level, if, instead of paying strict attention to the business of developing their internal industries and commerce, they had frittered away their energies in trying to establish themselves as a maritime power, for which nature had evidently unsuited them ? I do not think so. What we ought to do is to follow their example, and instead of having our attention diverted into making an attempt to become a maritime community, to increase the development of our internal resources.

I think that if, instead of making this annual payment to Great Britain - and it is admitted on all hands, even by those who advocate this Bill, that the contribution will be of no earthly consequence to Great Britain herself, seeing that her annual expenditure upon the navy is about 150 times that amount - we spent it upon acquiring a fleet of our own, vessel after vessel, or if we spent double that amount, at the end of ten years we should not certainly have a very large fleet, but we should have the beginnings of a fleet. .

If we had a small fleet of our own, I contend that we should be acting a much more patriotic part than we shall be acting in carrying out the policy submitted to us by the Government. What we ought to do with respect to Great Britain is this : We ought to say to her, "" We will provide for our own coastal defence. We will establish and support a fleet of our own, sufficient to look after the Australian coast, and we will thus relieve you of so much of your responsibility."" That is the position which the people of Australia ought to take up, and which they would take up if only the Government had the courage and the common sense to guide them aright. Whereever I went during the recess I found the feeling strongly in favour of an Australian fleet. This proposed subsidy was opposed in nearly every place I went to. It may be that the people did not fully understand the thing. "

718,1327,1,2,0,SENATE,3840,0,1327,"STEWART, James",K7D,Second Reading,bill,,,,0,0,"- I admit that they may not have understood the question thoroughly. It may be that the people with whom I conferred on the subject did not grasp what is the amount of money involved in the institution of an Australian fleet. But what they did grasp was that Australia, being to all intents and purposes a- self-governing country, should at any rate begin to have a fleet of her own. That was the idea which appeared to be firmly imbedded in the minds of the great majority of the people whom I met. As I have said, if, instead of paying £200,000 a year to Britain, we expended £500,000 per annum - and I am sure the people of the Commonwealth would not grudge that amount - on the establishment of a fleet of our own, would that not be a policy much more calculated to promote the best interests of .the Commonwealth? In ten or fifteen years probably we should have quite a respectable fleet on these Australian coasts, manned by Australians, under the control of the Australian Government, and ready, if need be, to go to any part in conjunction with the British fleet. The last condition would of course be entirely at the will of the Government of the day. Whereas, the position, as at present laid down, is that the people of Australia have absolutely no control over this arm of defence but are placed entirely in the hands of the British Government. I do not think that is a position we ought to be asked to occupy - it is not a position which carries with it any selfrespect. No community, which respects itself, could for a moment think of entering into an arrangement of that character. I really cannot conceive what was in the mind of the Prime Minister when he so weakly became a party to the agreement during his visit to Great Britain. I do not intend to' occupy the time of the Senate any longer. I have given a few reasons for the vote I intend to cast, and, if this measure is passed, I trust that when the agreement expires a Parliament sufficiently patriotic to make some attempt towards the establishment of a purely Australian fleet will be found sitting at the capital of the Commonwealth, wherever that may be.

These vessels are as much a part of the agreement as is the Auxiliary Squadron of which we hear so much, and cannot be dispensed with.
