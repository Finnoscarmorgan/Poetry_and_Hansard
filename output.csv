That is not the way in which to formulate a Tariff with a view to giving encouragement to the manufacturing industries. I am desirous to see farming implements, and all kinds of machinery necessary for the carrying on of industrial operations, manufactured within the Commonwealth, and am prepared to give every legitimate encouragement to manufacturers, but I do not wish to see them placed in such a position that they are able to dictate terms to the primary producers.

My constituency, which is about 200 miles long, contains very few large holdings. The great bulk of my constituents are farmers and dairymen, and it will be readily understood that they are vitally interested in any question which affects the cost of the machinery and implements which are used in connexion with their industry. In that respect, of course, they are typical of the great majority of the primary producers throughout the Commonwealth. Therefore, my efforts will be directed to securing to them the best and cheapest quality of implements and machinery that can possibly be obtained. To that extent I am thoroughly at one with the acting leader of the Opposition ; but I must confess that I differ with him as to the most desirable means of securing the best and cheapest implements. I am thoroughly in favour of placing on the free list any implements and machinery which cannot be manufactured within the Commonwealth, and of giving a moderate degree of protection to industries which have been successfully established, in order to enable them to compete with the importers.

The honorable member for the Barrier knows that agricultural implements manufactured in Victoria have successfully competed against the world in the markets of New South Wales to the extent of over £80,000 per annum, and that is the best possible proof of the success of the industry. If the industry were stamped out of existence the importers would raise prices to a level very much above those which now rule. In fact, I can point to implements which are not produced to any large extent in the Commonwealth, but the importers' prices of which are 100 per cent. above the cost of landing here. Ploughs, for instance, that can . be delivered here with all charges paid at £4 10s., are sold by the importers at £9. I am not prepared to stamp out local industries, and give 100 per cent. profit to importers. The policy which will guideme in dealing with this Tariff is to give reasonable protection - and I believe 15 per cent. is not one whit too much: - to those industries which can be successfully carriedon here, and. to place on the free list those articles which cannot be made in Australia. If the Government are prepared to act in that direction, I should advise them to ascertain what agricultural implements are not successfully manufactured here. "

68,1901-12-11,1,1,0,REPS,8544,0,1901-12-11,"MAHON, Hugh",KLB,TARIFF,Questions,,,,0,0,"- Possibly not to a very large extent. I do not carry all the figures of all the States in my head, so I may be excused from attempting to quote them. I merelywant the honorable member for Gippsland, or some other honorable member, to reconcile what appear to me to be two irreconcilable statements. I sympathize with the honorable member for Southern Melbourne in his effort to represent and conserve the interests of his constituents. But surely it will be allowed that a member like myself, whose constituents get no benefit from the Tariff, has an interest in seeing that they are not unnecessarily or improperly robbed. While I give the honorable member every sympathy, I ask some sympathy from him ; and if the honorable member is right in appealing on behalf of his constituents, I also am right in appealing to the impartial and independent members of the committee for some consideration for people who will receive no advantage from the Tariff. The honorable member for Southern Melbourne further said that it was a condition precedent to federation that State rights should be respected. That is an observation which cuts both ways. If the honorable member means that the State rights of Victoria to protection are to be respected, then he must also respect the free-trade rights of the people of New South Wales and of Western Australia. But if these rights be respected what is to become of the common Tariff? We are . merely playing at legislation if the honorable member's ideas are to be carried out. Surely the honorable member knows that the Tariff we are framing is not for one State, but for the six States of the Commonwealth. "

I do not believe in protection in any shape or form, though at the same time I do not believe in doing any damage that can possibly be avoided to an established industry. Now that we are discussing this interminable question of free-trade and protection, I should say that if honorable members really want to protect industries, they might do it in a better way by means of bonuses?

I cannot understand how a forward democrat like the Minister of Trade and Customs - a gentleman of extreme views, who so often goes to America for his ideas - should not have been able to discover a better system of protection than is here proposed. Why does he not insist on patentees of expensive machinery carrying on their manufacturing operations within the Commonwealth ? "

The right honorable gentleman could very well say to those people who are manufacturing cash registers, linotypes, monotypes, and other expensive patent machinery on which they are making from 400 per cent. to 500 per cent. over the cost price - "" We give you the benefit of our patent laws and of our Custom-house, but we are not going to do so after a certain time, say a year or eighteen months ; and, unless you manufacture the article in the Commonwealth, you shall not have the advantage of our laws.""

But, in any case, I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs how he justifies putting linotypes and monotypes, machines which can only be purchased by rich men, and which save labour enormously, enabling some newspaper owners to clear from £50,000 to £80,000 a year, on the free list, while taxing the poor farmer's reaper and binder.

I wish the Minister for Defence were here, because I have a little to say about the position of the unfortunate Western Australian farmer under this Tariff. This Tariff, as the Minister for Defence well knows, will give no benefit to the Western Australian farmer, or, at any rate, very little benefit, and certainly none whatever to the miner. What did the Minister for Defence, when Premier of Western Australia, do? The right honorable gentleman had studied the interests of the Western Australian farmer for a great many years, and the sort of duties he imposed on machinery were chaff-cutters 5 per cent., harrows free, horse-gear 5 per cent., and ploughs and shares free. These commodities are very largely imported into Western Australia. "

Surely honorable members know that farmers will not buy a foreign article if they can get a locally-made article as good and as cheap. In Western Australia last year the duty was the same on foreign and on Australian manufactures, and Western Australia in that year imported £11,916 worth of agricultural machinery manufactured in Great Britain and foreign countries, and £12,071 worth of agricultural machinery manufactured in the Australian States. A duty of 15 per cent. upon the importation of British and foreign machinery into Western Australia would produce £1,787 8s. ; but the Treasurer expects to get a return of only £750, so that he evidently thinks that the effect of the duty will be to shut out a very large part of the importationfrom Great Britain and other foreign countries. Hitherto Australian-made machinery has been able to compete in the New South Wales and Western Australian markets with the machinery manufactured in Great Britain and in foreign countries, and surely, with the larger market of the Commonwealth open to them, manufacturers will not want a protection of 15 per cent. against foreign competition. I should like some of the protectionists on the other side of the Chamberto explain the discrepancy between the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs that, if we have a free port, the surplus products of the world will be sent here at a very low price, and the statement of the honorable member for Gippsland that, without a duty, the cost of ploughs and other agricultural implements will be increased by over 100 per cent. as compared with the American prices.

87,1901-12-11,1,1,0,REPS,8546,0,1901-12-11,"MAUGER, Samuel",KNJ,TARIFF,Questions,Melbourne Ports,,,0,0,"- I shall endeavour to answer the honorable member's question. The honorable member for Gippsland stated that the result of freetrade would be to increase prices, and the honorable member for Coolgardie asks us to reconcile that statement with the statement of other protectionists that without a duty the market will be flooded with cheap foreign-made goods. If the honorable member for Coolgardie were acquainted with business transactions, he would easily realize the position. It does not follow that because goods are sent to Australia at a ridiculously low price the consumer benefits. As a matter of fact, the distributing houses regulate the trade, and pocket the difference between the cost of the article and the price charged to the consumer. "

I come now to deal with the question at issue, and I wish to begin by giving a list of the machinery which is being successfully manufactured in Victoria, and I believe in New South Wales and South Australia also. Thefollowing implements are beingmanufactured in thoseStates:- Ploughs, harvesters, strippers, winnowers, harrows, horse-hoes and garden-cultivators, fieldcultivators, grain-drills, wool-presses, chaffcutters, horse-works, bag-fillers, corncrushers, straw-pressers, turnip-slicers, rootpulpers, and maize-shellers.

The honorable member for North Sydney asked last night when will the time come when we shallnot require protection, and he stated that 30 years ago the protectionists pleaded that after a time our industries would be able to maintain their prestige without protection. I do not make myself responsible for the statement that we shall be able to do without protection after a certain period, and my answer to the honorable member's question last night was that we shall be able to do without it when conditions are equal and Australians get fair play.

Our manufacturers have to pay their employes fair rates of wages ; the men work only for certain hours, and various conditions are imposed by State legislation. In New South Wales, for instance, they have just passed an Arbitration and Conciliation Act, providing for the hearing of disputes between employes and employers. I ask, then, is it fair to compel our manufacturers, who have to carry on their industry under these conditions, to compete in the open market with manufacturers who pay lower wages and work their men longer hours, and are not subjected to similar restrictions ?

The moment we commenced to manufacture woollens successfully, our patterns were sent home, and a shoddy imitation of our goods was sent out here, undermining our trade, and ruining our mills. Is it fair that goods manufactured by Australian enterprise, from patterns of Australian invention, should be imitated by the manufacturers of Canada and America, and the imitations sent here to destroy our business?

The question is whether we shall subject our local manufacturers to reasonable conditions if we expose them to the unrestricted competition of the outside world. Prom the first day that harvesters were locally manufactured in Victoria, the price has been gradually decreased. The price of the first harvester, fifteen years ago, was £100, but the machines are now sold at from £75 to £80. From fair competition with similar harvesters made in other parts of the world, we have nothing to fear, but it is not fair to our farmers, or to our manufacturers, or to the community generally, that spurious imitations of what is peculiarly an Australian invention should be placed upon our market, to the prejudice of the locally-manufactured article. I have here a number of testimonials from practical farmers, who speak in the highest terras of the good qualities of our harvesters. "

I harvested 170 acres with it, yielding three to eight bags per acre and averaging twelve acres per day, turning out a better sample than I have ever had from a threshing machine. The cost of harvesting same did not exceed1s. per acre. I consider the machine is as good now as whenI got it, and it has not cost me1s. for repairs. I am also satisfied that the waste is a great deal less than with the reaper and binder, and I shall certainly recommend it to any one requiring a harvesting machine. "

I would remind honorable members that the farmers ought to bear their share of taxation, and even if it be granted that protective duties are taxes - -which I do not admit - and the farmers are relieved of imposts in this direction, we shall have to make them pay in some other way. If the farmers incidentally pay taxation in this way and help the manufacturer?, surely it will be to their benefit, and to the advantage of  the Commonwealth in the long run. No section of the community has received the same aid and encouragement as the farmers - at any rate the Victorian farmers. Immense sums of money have been devoted to water conservation and to the payment of bonuses for the encouragement of agriculture.

All I desire is to give fair play to our manufacturers and to our workmen, and not to leave them exposed to the operations of trade robbers.

The question of the duty on agricultural machinery occasionally crops up, but we have apparently entered upon a general discussion of the respective merits of free-trade and protection. I thought we had disposed of that matter in the early stages of the Tariff debate, but unfortunately the air does not seem to be particularly clear, and I may be pardoned for saying a word or two on the general fiscal question. We are told that the object of affording protection to manufacturers is to secure our own markets to our own people. W e are also informed that the conditions under which workmen are employed iri the various industries of Australia are much better than are to be found in other parts of the world, and that our industries would suffer if our products were subjected to free competition with goods manufactured by cheaper labour in foreign countries. I would ask what is the whole object of protection. Is it not to build up industries that shall be able not only to supply all our own requirements, but eventually to successfully compete in the world's markets "

He approached the Victorian Government a second time with a request that they should impose an additional 2s. 6d. per cwt. upon nails, intimating that if they did so he thought he would be able to carry on the industry. The Government acceded to his request, and levied a duty of 7s. 6d. per cwt. upon nails, and, he adds - "" I have cleared my £16,000."" I should like to know who really paid that £16,000. The circular points out that the price of nails has been reduced from 61/2d. to 21/2d. per lb. during the past 17 years. But almost every commodity during that period has been considerably reduced in price owing to the application of inventive skill. Does anybody mean to tell me that the nailmaker to whom I have been referring did not make that £16,000 owing to the extra amount of protection which he had received ? I should also like to point out to the Minister for Trade and Customs that a number of the articles included in this item, such as sheep-shearing machines, portable engines, and locomotive boilers ought to be placed upon the free list. The right honorable gentleman has already exempted hand-shears from duty. If it is right to regard hand-shears as tools of trade, and to include them in the schedule of special exemptions it is equally right to exempt sheep-shearing machines from duty because the shearers have to pay for the cutters and combs which form part of the machines. I have known them to pay as much as 7s. per week for the purchase of new cutters and combs, which, of course, means a considerable reduction in their wages. Moreover, it is getting quite a common thing for the shearer to carry his own machine. Hundreds of men carry their own machines in Queensland, and I suppose the same remark is applicable to other parts of Australia. Under such circumstances I think that these tools of trade should be placed upon the free list. Moreover, all these machines are manufactured in England. It would not pay to make them here, because there is not a sufficient demand for them. I might further point out that a large number of small portable and other engines are used in connexion with , the mining industry. A number of men become partners in a ""show "" upon a new field, and owing to the quality of the water, or because of other drawbacks, are compelled to use machinery. "

While trying to do what we can to assist farming and other industries, we should make an effort to do what is fair and right in the way of assisting men who develop our mineral resources. When a field like Charters Towers, Mount Morgan, or Croydon is found, where thousands of men are likely to be employed, the discovery is usually made by some half-dozen men, and is worth more to the country than many industries such as are protected under the Tariff.I would remind the Minister for Trade and Customs that, while agricultural and other machinery is put on the 1 5 per cent. list, mining machinery is called upon to pay 25 per cent., and I think both ought to be put on the same basis.

We should be in an entirely abnormal position if we hoped to establish industries in this country and supply our own needs, unless we followed in the same track and adopted the principles of every other nation of modern times. Withoutexception, no nation has attained commercial or manufacturing importance, except with the help of protection. The honorable member for Kennedy appears to think that we are going to produce largely, while our population is not going to increase. But we not only hope to produce more both in the country and in the towns, but also to attract a very large population to these shores. That population we cannot expect unless we are prepared to find work for them ; and it is impossible to find work for all our people in the primary industries. It is equally impossible that we can have any other industries, unless we follow the lead of other nations and adopt protection. It is possible that the time will come when we shall over-produce, and when we shall have to take the world's price. Then we cannot expect to keep up high wages by means of boards ; and here I would say that I do not feel myself bound to indorse all the views of my friends in the metropolis of Melbourne as to the efficacy of these boards. I believe that the result of the Tariff will be that ""Wages Boards will not be able to keep up the  present minimum  wages which, in some cases, appear to be unreasonably high. "

We all support the idea that a fair day's wages should be paid for a fair day's work, and that employers who refuse to pay such wages should be compelled by legislation to do so. I represent a constituency almost entirely composed of farmers ; and I have not received from any portion of the district a request that the duty on implements should be lower than at present. The only communication I have had on the subject has been one asking me to prevent the duties being raised to any higher figure than that proposed by the Government. I have never found a farmer unreasonable, or ready to ruthlessly cut away the protection under which industries have been fostered, and thus be guilty of the worst possible faith to those men whom we have encouraged to invest their money. How can we expect that men with capital will establish industries here and find work  for our population - how can we expect them to fight the battle against the whole world and purchase raw material from our producers - if they do not receive some assistance in the early stages "

Canada and the United  Staes could make no head way  until they adopted a fair  sytem  of protection, and whenever they lowered the duties, or resorted to free-trade, they retrogressed. It is an astonishing fact that in all countries where manufactures have progressed under protection, farmers have progressed at  the  same time; and to-day, in protected countries, the primary industries are greater in extent, in comparison with manufactures, than they are in unprotected countries. The honorable member for Coolgardie has asked why we do not insist on patentees coming here to manufacture. But how could we do that "

In the State Parliament of ""Victoria we had a gentleman of the same free-trade proclivities, who was called the "" extinguisher,"" because he proposed to sweep away every duty ; and I am afraid that the acting leader of the Opposition will earn the name of the "" industrydestroyer."" He has determined that we shall have no manufactures here - that we shall try to develop the country by commerce, and not by protection. I do not know of any country which has  progressd   by commerce alone, and I do not think we shall be able to better the examples which the world presents to us. The honorable member for North Sydney, and other honorable members, have asked why we do not allow the farmer to have his implements free, in the same way that implements are allowed free ' in other industries which are protected in the cities. The acting leader of the Opposition has said that we tax the farmer on everything he eats, drinks, wears, and uses ; but that is an absolutely incorrect statement. In the Tariff there are more articles on the farmer's free list than on the free list connected with any other industry in the country. Certain , machinery is exempt from duty because it is patented machinery. The honorable member for Coolgardie has asked why linotypes and monotypes, belonging 'to the rich newspaper proprietors, should be let in free, while the farmer is taxed. The reason simply is that these machines cannot be produced in Australia, and they are  brought here  for the  general good  - in order to cheapen the press to the people. We have adopted the same principle with regard to farming implements. Reapers and binders and cream separators, which are patented, and cannot be produced here, are allowed to come in free ; but we place a duty upon other agricultural implements, in order to prevent foreign manufacturers from competing with our own manufacturers, who are able to produce machinery quite as cheaply and better adapted to the conditions of our people.

The statements of the acting leader of the Opposition were, no doubt, made with a purpose. We heard the other night that there is to be a grand free-trade propaganda, and no doubt these statements will be quoted at the meetings which free-trade hirelings will be sent to address. The honorable member for Wentworth does not want to see manufactories established here ; he wants our raw material to be sent elsewhere to be manufactured. But, surely we should try to produce within our own borders all that we require. We have the iron and the men, and why should we not make our own agricultural machinery ? But we cannot do it without protection. Honorable members seem to forget that one of our chief objects should be to try and obtain possession of the home market for our own producers. "

I shall join with the honorable member for Moira in asking that certain implements shall be exempt from taxation, and with those exemptions I think that farmers should be fairly satisfied with the Government proposal. If honorable members went to the Royal Show in Melbourne, and saw the magnificent array of agricultural implements and machinery manufactured in the State that is exhibited there, and compared the 1,100 workers whom the industry employs in Victoria with the 193 whom it employs in New South Wales, they would be able to contrast the effects of the policies of the two States. Twenty years ago the cost of reaping a crop was 12s. 6d. an acre, but the introduction of the reaper and binder reduced it to 4s. per acre, and I am told that now, by the use of a locally-invented harvester, the work can be done for1s. per acre. These harvesters came into use about 1894, and in that year one firm manufactured eighteen of them. In 1895, however, that firm made as many as 50, and in 1896 their production of harvesters increased to 75, in 1897 to 125, in 1898 to 225, in 1899 to 300, and in 1900 to 500.

The honorable member for Coolgardie cannot understand how free-trade should make things dearer and protection make them cheaper, but with protection local competition is created, whereas, under free-trade, local competition is rendered impossible, and importers, once they have command of the market, form rings, and put up prices as they please.

They are content to pay revenue duties imposed through the Customs, because they know that the only alternative will be the land tax, to which the members of the free-trade party are driving the farmer at the present time.

152,1901-12-11,1,1,0,REPS,8553,0,1901-12-11,"MCCOLL, James",KQ4,TARIFF,Questions,,,,0,0,"- It is not a bogie, because we know what the programme of the Free-trade Democratic League is. We are told that the natural protection afforded by the cost of importation from foreign countries is sufficient to enable local manufacturers to successfully compete with outside competitors, but it has been shown that it costs more to send implements from inland towns to the seaboard than to bring them from America and Germany to the Commonwealth. We know very well that pig and rough manufactured iron is brought out to this country for as little as 10s. per ton, or less than it costs to carry it a few miles on our railways. In Melbourne we have a Hardware Association, and country storekeepers have told me that it is nothing more nor less than a Tammany ring, which is intended to control the hardware trade, and to so fix prices that no one can withstand the importers. If we close up our workshops we shall have this Tammany ring operating in agricultural implements in a way that they are not now able to do, owing to the local competition to which the imported goods are subjected. Honorable members opposite have changed their tune from time to time, and the organ that represents them has also altered its attitude. At one time a 15 per cent. duty was advocated upon all articles used by the farmer, but now it is desired to sweep that duty away. I represent a farming constituency, and I assert that if this 15 per cent. duty is swept away, and our agricultural implement makers are exposed to the competition of the whole world, it will not be very long before there is a cry for the re-imposition of the duty. Having due regard to the necessity for keeping faith with those who have established the manufacture of agricultural implements within the Commonwealth, and who as a rule have not made a great deal of money, and also considering the benefits which follow from the employment of a large number of men and the utilisation of our raw material, it would be a great mistake to abolish the duty.

Honorable members must see that it is utterly impossible for Shearer's shares to have been bought at the same price in Victoria as that for which they were sold in South Australia, where they were manufactured. If they were sold at as low a price in Victoria, the South Australian manufacturer was doing an injustice to the farmer of his own State, inasmuch as if he could afford to pay a 15 per cent. duty upon them, and sell them at 35s. per dozen in Victoria, he could have afforded to sell them for considerably less where they were manufactured. I have no hesitation in saying that the statement of prices given by the honorable member for South Australia, "

I do not propose to give the present prices of goods in the two States mentioned, but I will give the quotations from last year. At that period there was no certainty as to what the Tariff would be, or as to who would be returned to power. All we knew was that there was a protective Tariff in Victoria, and a free-trade Tariff in New South Wales. At that time the Victorian Tariff on agricultural implements was 15 percent, or '3s. in the £1, and the figures I am about to quote will, I think, convince any thoughtful man that the assertion that the consumer does not pay a protective duty is absurd. There is a company known as the Massey-Harris Company, who, with  depôts  in Victoria, New South Wales, and other States, are the largest importers in Australia of agricultural machinery. I have selected a few farming implements, the figures in regard to which will speak for themselves. I find that in 1900, a  scuffler  No. 2. was sold in Melbourne at £2 10s., and in Sydney at £2 7s. 6d. A larger size of the same implement was sold in Melbourne for £3 lis. 3d., and in Sydney for £3 6s. 6d. ; a new Model No. 10 plough was sold in Melbourne for £4 15s., and in Sydney for £4 12s. ; double-furrowed ploughs were sold in Melbourne at £8 lis., and in Sydney at £7 12s. There are something like sixteen similar articles, and in every case the price was higher in protective Melbourne than in free-trade Sydney. How can honorable members in the face of those facts assert that protection does not increase the cost to the consumer? Honorable members, if they are open to argument, must be convinced that under a free-trade policy we are able to buy what we want at a lower price than under protection. I am willing to admit that a heavy protective duty will induce a number of persons to commence industries, but the result is that the men with the largest capital come to the top. Those who enter into manufacturing with insufficient capital, or who perhaps are not thoroughly conversant with the details of the business, invariably go to the wall. For a short time the farmer undoubtedly gets the benefit of a cheaper rate ; that is to say, he probably gets an article which may or may not be as good as the imported article. But the manufacturers having -gone into competition amongst themselves the weaker go to the wall, and the one or two who survive put their prices just a shade below those of the imported article. If thelocal article is a good one, the manufacturers, put the duty in their pockets, but if it benot as good as the imported, the farmergrumbles, and pays more for the imported, article than he would under a free-trade arrangement, lt is all very well for honorable members to talk about fair wages, and that sort of clap-trap, which may appeal tocertain men in their constituencies, but weare not here to pander to any small section of  the community. We are  here to try to do whatis best for the whole ot Australia. We must remember that the agricultural, pastoral, and. viticultural industries employ people who outnumber by one hundred or five hundred to one the artisans engaged in the trades f or which we have heard such piteous appeals. I speak on behalf of the farmers, the prices of whose production cannot possibly beincreased by a protective policy. I urgehonorable members to seriously consider the. effect that this Tariff will have on thewhole of the States, four of which, until these monstrous proposals were introduced,, were practically free-trade, and able to buy in the cheapest markets. It is impossiblefor the Government in the way of bonuses, to give the farming, agricultural, or pastoral industries any assistance, seeing that thoseengaged have to go into the markets of theworld and take the best prices obtainable. I ask honorable members to reflect seriously before inflicting a blow which I honestly believe will be deadly to the best  interests.of  Australia. "

As a matter of fact, I do not think there is much difference on this subject between the two parties in the Chamber. The kinds of agricultural machinery which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports enumerated as being made in Victoria are all used in New South Wales, and the honorable member for Grampians told us last night that he was a farmer in a large way, and used locally-manufactured machinery and implements, and found them to work very well. No doubt the honorable member for Robertson will say that 15 per cent. is a very high duty to make the poor farmer pay upon his plough. "

But if I went on the hustings with the honorable member I should ask him to finish the story, and to tellthe farmers that the ploughs and other agricultural implements they use come from Victoria, and have and always will be admitted free of duty. They pay no duty upon their ploughs, harvesters, winnowers, harrows, disc-harrows, field-cultivators, grain drills, and wool-presses. The Ferrier woolpress which is made in Geelong is used all over New South Wales, and, I believe, in Queensland too, so that the farmers pay no duty upon it. The same remark applies to bag-fillers, and double chaff-cutters. I found it cheaper to buy these things in Victoria and carry them 1,200 miles, than to purchase imported machinery in Sydney. "

But, at the same time, it is not fair to ask local manufacturers to try to establish their industries without a moderate share of protection. I would, however, while an industry is being started, give assistance to those who have to use imported machinery. The honorable member for Kennedy stated that under protection our manufacturers would very soon overtake the market, and then over produce, but we must first of all obtain possession of our home market. Hitherto we in New South Wales have paid more for our agricultural machinery than they have paid in Victoria. Prices of agricultural machinery in New South Wales has been largely governed by importer's rings, because there has been no local competition. I believe that we are all here to do the best that we can for our constituents. Before we sought election we were at liberty to call ourselves freetraders or protectionists, to espouse the "" revenuewithoutdestruction "" doctrine or to become revenue tariffists, and the principles we enunciated must have found favour with our constituents, or we should not have been here. I think that we have greatly improved the Tariff so far, by the changes which we have made, and that other alterations will make it still more acceptable to the people. Before voting for a protective duty I shall want to know, as I did in the case of hats, that an industry can be successfully established here. "

If we manufacture our own requirements here, we shall increase the amount of employment, and thus attract more people here. By increasing our population we increase our consumption, and therefore give a large market for our producers, and benefit every one all round. By adding to our population we shall increase our wealth and develop our resources. I wish to see all implements of trade placed in the hands of those engaged in industrial occupations as cheaply as possible, and I do not intend to vote in favour of imposing heavy taxation uponthe farmer. I am largely interested in farming myself, and the electorate which I represent is greatly dependent upon the success of the farming industry. At the same time I desire to encourage local industry wherever I am satisfied that employment can be given with profit not only to those engaged in it, but to the community generally. "

The honorable member for Robertson represents a constituency in which farming is carried on to an even greater extent than in the Gwydir district ; the honorable member for Parramatta represents a portion of the country in which there is a very large number of farmers ; the honorable member for Macquarie, and the honorable member for Canobolas, have many farmers among their constituents ; and I have the honour of representing the oldest and largest dairying constituency probably in the whole of Australasia. The honorable member for Gwydir seems to think that a 15 per cent. duty on agricultural implements will not operate to the prejudice of the farmers. It is a remarkable fact, however, that when we were considering the proposed duty on salt, the honorable member for Gwydir, and the honorable member for New England, both of whom are pastoralists, and whose pockets would beconsiderably affected by theproposed duty, immediately came over to this sideof the Chamber, and voted among the free-traders. We were told by the honorable member for Echuca that he had never found the farmers ready to ruthlessly destroy manufacturing industries by opposing protective duties, but I would remind the honorable member that conditions throughout the States have been very much changed by the establishment of federation. Nearly the whole of the farmers of Victoria - I know it was the case with a great many of the New South Wales farmers - became protectionists in consequence of the competition between the various States, but they now realize that protection does not offer them the same advantages under Inter-State free-trade as prior to its establishment. We cannot by any system of protection impose duties that will benefit the farmer, and therefore all the protectionist imposts that are now being provided for will operate to the advantage of the manufacturers, and the primary producers of Australia will have to pay the cost. We were told by the honorable member for Echuca that he was surprised at our disregard of the interests of the manufacturers, but I can assure him that free-traders are just as anxious as any one else to see manufacturing industries prosper. We object, however, by means of a protective Tariff, to give a few manufacturers an opportunity to dip deeply into the pockets of the people. We do not object to the establishment of manufacturing industries, we would hail their establishment with delight, but we are opposed to the farmers and pastoralists, miners and others, who are engaged in the primary industries, being robbed to make a few manufacturers rich. We were told by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports that we were now a united nation, and that we ought to entertain brotherly love towards one another. But what the honorable member desires is that the people of New South Wales should be compelled, whether they like it or not, to buy the manufactured products of Victoria. The honorable and learned member for Corinella told us that in this case protection had had the effect of building up an export trade, and he stated that out of £96,000 worth of agricultural machinery exported from Victoria, £81,000 worth was sent to New South Wales. If the agricultural implement manufacturers of Victoria are able to export their goods beyond the borders of the State, and compete in the open free-trade markets, surely, in view of the fact that the whole of the markets of Australia are now open to them, they should be able to carry on without the assistance of protective duties. After hearing the whining appeals that have been made both in this House and out of it, on behalf of the protected industries of Victoria, including the agricultural implement industry, I think that, unless they are able to stand alone, the sooner we get rid of them the better. But there is no fear that these industries will fail if the duty is removed, because they have been flourishing for many years in New South Wales under a policy of free-trade. "

Bub at the same time honorable members have to recollect the interests of the whole Common-wealth. The only way in which we can frame a Tariff which is fair and just to Australia, is by endeavouring to reconcile State interests with the interests of the Commonwealth. The policy which the Prime Minister put before the people of Queensland at Toowoomba, during the federal election campaign, was one of revenue without destruction of existing industries. He put it that established industries in the various States at the time of Federation should be considered. I supported that policy at ray election. Probably there is no constituency in Australia which is more devoted to agricultural pursuits than is that which I have the honour to represent. I see that Victoria imports roughly about half her agricultural implements. New South Wales imports nearly the whole of her agricultural implements, most of them from oversea. In 1900 Queensland imported £59,295 worth of this class of machinery. Of this amount £8,688 worth came from Victoria, £3,157 worth from South Australia, and £874 worth "

There are in all 98 articles of a similar character, and, in addition, others which, though they cannot be regarded as tools of trade, are still incidental to farming. With few exceptions these articles are not produced within the Commonwealth, and they include alum, sulphur, different manures, meat wraps, blasting powder, rabbit traps, veterinary instruments, and a number of others. I trust we have heard the last of this gross - I do not say wilful - misstatement which has been so frequently made and unjustly circulated. In regard to machinery, I take the same position as do other honorable members on this side. Machinery which cannot be produced in the Commonwealth I should like to see admitted free. I am not in favour of revenue duties, but of protective duties ; and if we tax articles which are not manufactured here, the duty becomes purely one for revenue. In regard to harvesters, thanks to the in- .  genuity,  industry, and enterprise of our manufacturers, we occupy a position second to none in any part of the world.

What surprises me is that the honorable member for Laanecoorie has not discerned the different treatment meted out to the secondary industries. He starts off by talking about two or three trumpery tools of trade in connexion with farming. As a matter of fact, the selfishness of protectionists, and of the secondary industries and those who support them, is more strikingly shown every day. It is most singular that there is not a tool of trade required by the protectionist which is not on the free list, even to the most costly machinery. Look at the different treatment given to the farmer. Are not ploughs and other similar implements the farmer's tools of trade, just as much as printing machinery is the tool of trade of the newspaper proprietor? "

While the manufacturers want all their tools of trade on the free list, they wish agricultural implements, mining machinery, and machinery used by pastoralists, which are equally the tools of trade of the farmers, the miners, and the wool-growers and shearers, to be heavily taxed. Machinery for the manufacture of paper and felting, machinery used in the process of electrotyping and stereotyping, machine tools used in apparel and attire making, bookbinding, boot-making, brash-making, glass-making, hat-making, leather-dressing aud metalworking, is on the free list ; but on agricultural machinery there is a duty of 15 per cent. Directly it is proposed to put any other machinery on the free list, the Government are deluged with the complaints of manufacturers that a duty should be placed upon it so that it may be manufactured in Australia. All lines of agricultural machinery, including reapers and binders, are cheaper to-day than they were a few years back, or even twelve months ago, but that is not the result of protection. "

But most of the agricultural implements used by farmers are taxed. Now that we export om- meat, and wool, and minerals, and grain, our primary producers cannot benefit by the imposition of duties upon those products, because they are forced to compete in the markets of the world against the cheap labour and the best machinery of other places, and they have to pay high freights. That being so, why should they be handicapped by having to pay  heavy  duties upon what are practically their tools of trade? The other day a gentleman twitted me with having voted against the salt duty, and in reply I asked him why he had increased the price of his salt. He said - ""We divided the duty.

In justice to his firm, however, I should say that the moment the duty was put upon salt, the shipping agents increased their freights. What the manufacturers want is not so much to keep out the productions of other places as to increase the prices of their own manufactures. I should have no objection to giving an advantage to local men if prices were not increased to the consumer thereby. But whenever duties are imposed, prices are increased.

The honorable member demonstrated that a certain class of ploughshares made in South Australia cost more in New South Wales and Queensland than in either South Australia or Victoria, where the industry is protected. This state of affairs is brought about by the fact that in the northern States all local competition has been crushed out, and the importers have been able to keep the trade entirely in their own hands and fix prices to suit themselves.

Another peculiar disadvantage under which the farmer labours in connexion with imported machinery is that if he attempts to build up a reaper and binder with duplicate parts he will find that the machine, instead of costing him £50, will involve him in an expense of about £200. This is owing to the exorbitant prices charged by the importers for the duplicate parts. The sameconditions do not exist in connexion with machines and implements of local manufacture, because the local makers supply the farmers with duplicate parts at exactly the cost' price as put in the original machine. It has been stated that the development of the agricultural industry in Victoria gave rise to the establishment of the manufacture of implements and machines, but quite the reverse was the case. Theimprovements in agricultural implements and machinery have been the chief factor in developing the agricultural industry"" of Victoria. The immense areas now under cultivation in the northern district of Victoria would never have been brought under the plough if it had' not been for the progress made in the local manufacture of agricultural implements.

The same thing is an every day occurrence even in our stock markets. The man who wants to purchase stock will do anything that is legitimate to bear down the prices.. But some honorable members ask - "" If this industry is established, what reason is there for continuing to afford it protection?""' This question may best be answered by a. simple illustration. In Victoria a harvester - a purely Australian invention - has; enabled the farmers to harvest their grain under certain climatic conditions at a very low cost ? What has happened with respectto that particular machine for which the  patent rights were not taken  out?. Two or three machines were bought up last year by an enterprising American firm which has taken them to America, and which, in all probability, will soon offer them to the Australian farmer at a reduced price. But the trouble is that these machines will not be consigned from America direct to the man who uses them. They will be consigned from, say, Brown, Smith, and Jones in America to Brown, Smith, and Jones in Melbourne. They will be invoiced at the firm's own price, and will PaY duty only upon that amoun t. They will thus, perhaps, beat our local manufacturers out of the market. As soon as that result ha3 been achieved, this firm will fix a price which will compensate them for whatever loss they may have sustained in gaining control of the Australian market, and thus they will eventually get our farmer under their thumb. Why is the old battle-cry - that the result of protection is to increase the cost of any article to the consumer - abandoned in this instance "

The machinery employed in many manufacturing industries is admitted free, simply because the volume of trade to be developed is not sufficient to justify any sane person in laying down the necessary plant for its manufacture. It has been asked why the machines used in the woollen industry are allowed to come in free. But what amount of machinery is used in this industry throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth ? There are only eight or ten mills engaged in the industry ; and would there would be any justification for laying down plant for the manufacture of the necessary machinery ? I unhesitatingly say there would be no justification. The machinery cannot be made here, and there is no large field or scope for operations ; if a plant were laid down, it would lie idle for eleven and a half months in the year. The same argument applies to other industries. I am prepared to go so far as to admit free the patent and intricate machinery used  in mining  particularly in Western Australia and the northeastern parts of Victoria. ' But where the field of operations is sufficiently large to invite competition amongst the manufacturers, and there is a possibility of producing the article without increasing the cost to the consumer, I should give whatever 24 s "

I know that it is impossible under existing conditions to get anything like a scientific protective Tariff; but we ought to get as near to such a Tariff as we can. I fully recognise the necessity for revenue. What is hurting the farmer and the general populace is the high revenue duty which must be levied in many instances. Before I am asked to support a proposal to put on the free list all the machinery used in the industries which have been established under a protective Tariff, I require some proof that protective duties have increased the cost to the consumer. I have made inquiries in regard to the incidence of this Tariff, as compared with the Victorian Tariff, and it must be admitted that there has been a reduction all along the line. I have further made careful inquiries amongst trades-people, and I find that there has been no reduction in prices in consequence of the reduction in duties since 8th October. "

The cost of transit to the farm and of sending the produce away to market is exactly the same, and in no single instance does the 'New South Wales farmer come out on the best side, the cost of his household keep being more than in Victoria.

The tools of trade which do come in free, and which are used by the farmer, comprise some 27 articles altogether, and include such insignificant commodities as augurs, adzes, awls, axles, chisels, drills, files and rasps, and garden shears. The value of these runs from ls. up to 2s., and in some cases as high as 5s. each, and the total value of the 27 articles is under £3. That represents the benefit which the farmer receives from the free list in the shape of tools ; and there is no doubt that a large number of these tools would not be on the free list if they were not used in other trades by carpenters and people of that class.

'With regard to reapers and binders, there is a proposal under Division 6a to tax them at the rate of 15 per cent. ; but I hope the committee will not agree to it. The discussion of the item before the committee involves the question : how ought we to treat the farming and producing interests of the Commonwealth ? Are the manufacturing interests to be bolstered up at the expense of the primary producers, who can get no protection? The farmers are perfectly willing to pay their fair share of taxation, but, as they receive no protection, they ask that the machinery which they use shall be admitted free. The agricultural implement manufacturers of Victoria, 35 years ago, asked for a fair measure of protection, so that they might be enabled to start their industry, and they hoped to be able after a time to do without support. But, notwithstanding the fact that they have been bolstered up for 35 years, they are still crying out for protection. Therefore, we have to consider whether we should pay attention to the claims of the manufacturers rather than to those of the farmers, and I range myself on the side of the farmers. Is it fair and right that the producers should be heavily taxed upon everything they use when they get no benefit from protection themselves ? "

I acknowledge - and I am happy to pay this tribute to the general excellence of the agricultural implements manufactured in Victoria - that this industry produces very good and useful implements, and locally-made implements will be used by the farmer whether we have a duty or not.

Those who are engaged in the primary industries should be relieved of taxation as far as possible, and I hope the Treasurer will see his way to reduce the duty from 15 per cent, to 10 per cent. The rates adopted in this Tariff are assumed to represent a compromise based upon the duties previously levied in the various states, but the Victorian rate has been adopted by the Government, who have apparently overlooked the distinct advantages that the manufacturers will obtain from the t wider market which will be opened to them under Inter-State freetrade.

There are several lines that we think ought to beadjusted, andif you would lend your influence in that direction, we think it would mean an improvement on the proposed rates of duty. We think raw material should be placed on the free list, particularly bar, sheet, and galvanized iron, and all bolts and nuts below, say,½-inch diameter, inclusive, andNettlefold's screws. If 10 per cent. duty on bar iron should come into operation, say, in a few years, it would mean that all Australia would be penalized 10 per cent. , or be compelled to use colonial-made iron, which it is very doubtful would be up to the quality required. It would be preferable to subsidize the company instead. If theraw material, bolts, &c. , were kept on the free list, we think it would then be fair to reduce the duty on strippers, winnowers, and ploughs, by 5 per cent. Ploughshares,we are satisfied, could not be reduced without in juring the trade, in that branch. It is quite a new industry here, and has to fight against big odds, and should be afforded protection for at least another ten years. The reason, we think, the duty on strippers, winnowers, and ploughs, could be reduced is, because the present duty is inoperative in many instances, and we feel sure if the farmers saw the duty down to 10 per cent., they would then feel the possibility of their having to pay the amount of duty to local manufacturers, as well as the price of the machinery would be minimized. We are fully satisfied that no duty on any goods whatever should exceed 25 per cent., and any manufacturer that cannot make headway on that should stop at once. "

I may also mention that in company with the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs, I recently interviewed one of the leading manufacturers of Melbourne. We put the case to him, and he unhesitatingly assured us that if his raw material were admitted free he could get along very well with a duty of 10 per cent. upon the manufactured article. I am perfectly satisfied that no fiscal proposal can increase the price of the farmers' produce, but we can do a great deal in the framing of this Tariff to lessen the cost of production. For that reason I intend to move that the duty upon these implements should be reduced to 10 per cent. That is a moderate duty, and according to the opinions of the two leading manufacturer's to whom I have referred,it will enable them to live, and will not exclude the imported article. My desire is to see a fair competition. I do not wish to absolutely exclude the imported article, but I desire to see the importer and the manufacturer come into competition, so that the consumer may get the benefit of that competition.

The honorable member for  Echuca, on the occasion to which I refer, went on to say that if the stock tax were removed ""the arch of protection would probably tumble to pieces."" I can only hope that the honorable member's prophecy may prove correct. If these duties on agricultural implements were simply for the purpose of raising revenue, and money was really wanted, I should be prepared to support them. But we find a certain section of the community selected for special taxation - that section which we particularly want to encourage to remain on the land - and, though I do not say they have borne the burden of protection, it should be the duty of statesmen to endeavour to decentralize as much as possible, and remove the aggregation of population from the large towns, withthe object of inducing the people to live healthy lives in the country, and bring about that settlement we so much desire.

Not only is protection a variable expedient, but it has been shown to be a variable quantity altogether. One thing whichhas amused me since coming into this Parliament has been the easy way in which honorable members on the Government side have made for themselves definitions of protection. It is the easiest thing in the world to prove a case if the person who proves it can make his own statement of the case. For the first time in the history of the fiscal question we have been told that protection consists in making roads and bridges and in giving cheap land. I have yet to learn that any economist has ever given so absurd a definition of protection. Surely we have come to Victoria to learn something when we are told that giving people moderately cheap land is the protection about which the world has talked so much for the last 100 years. This is all done to try to gull the farmer into the belief that he is getting some advantage to compensate him for the heavy charges which he is made to pay in order to bolsterup the manufacturing industries of the country. But, in my opinion, the farmers of this and the other States will not be so easily gulled. They will be able to see through these subterfuges. I take exception to the provincial tone which has been adopted by the Minister for Trade and Customs and other honorable members on that side of the chamber. He gyrated along the floor in his usual Jack-in-the-box style, throwing out charges of selfishness and wrong-doing against every State except that in which he happens to be. The other night he went out of his way to tell a representative of Western Australia that Western Australia had to be paid to come into the union. That is nice language for a Minister, who is supposed to serve the whole continent, to use. It was in keeping with his statement at the town hall the other night that New South Wales had to be paid, and to be given special concessions, before she would come in. "

I am prepared to give the committee the names of the two manufacturers who, instead of patronizing their own product, import an engine from the other side of the world to do their own work. We are asked to impose duties of 15 per cent, on oil engines, and of 25 per cent, on gas engines to maintain manufacturers who have not the pluck to use their own products. Again they take the parts out of an old Crossley engine which has been in use for ten or twelve years and which has run down, make patterns of them and use them in a new engine. The result is that while a Crossley engine of 8 nominal horse-power gives 20 brake horse-power as against a locally manufactured engine of 8 horse-power giving only 13 brake horse-power. Tenders were recently invited in this city for a gas-engine, and will it be believed that after the payment of the duty operating, the manufacturer of the imported engine was able to put in a tender only 5 per cent, in excess of that of the local manufacturer? We are often told that protection does not increase the price of goods. But in this instance advantage was immediately taken of the duty imposed to increase the price. If there are any valiant honorable members upon the opposite side of the House who desire to draw a moral from the inconsistency of using a Victorian pump at Mort's Dock, I am ready to give the names and addresses of people in the city of Melbourne who have the gross effrontery to come to this Parliament and ask for a heavy subsidy on behalf of their twopenny - halfpenny manufactures, and yet who have not the pluck to use an engine of their own make.

He has paid a compliment to New South Wales, though he was afraid to call that the mother State or the senior State, and I think he must look on it as the step-mother State. The debate has drifted away from the question really before the Chair, but the Minister for Trade and Customs is answerable for that. Last night he went into the whole question of free-trade and protection, and from that time we have had speeches from both sides on those lines. I recognise that the Government are placed in a very strange position. This potentate of protection, the Minister for Trade and Customs, imagined he would have a strong body of protectionists at his back in this House, but he must have found that the expedients of protection are of such a character that the bulk of those on the Government side are only supporters of the policy as it applies to their particular electorates. The expression on the face of the Minister when honorable members behind him, while not proposing to take the duty off altogether, say they are prepared to go half way to that end, is that of political disgust. On this side of the House we do not find honorable members varying their fiscal opinions according to the districts they represent. We do not say, because we have a Mort's Dock or a Clyde Works within our constituencies, that we desire protection. Freetraders do not alter their policy to suit some particular portion of their electorates. But the protectionists, when certain interests in their districts are likely to be affected by the proposals of the Government, vote against protection. The Minister read with dramatic force a message in regard to the closing of the Clyde Engineering Works but he did not read a similar message in regard to the closing of Messrs. Cameron and Sons works, at Kapunda, South Australia, in 1887, when the Playford Tariff was brought in. The Minister for Trade and Customs said last night that it was not his duty to pursue the fortunes of any firm ; neither is it mine. Probably it would have been better if the Minister had not referred to these firms at all. Disaster may overtake a company through overcapitalization, bad management, or other causes quite unconnected with the fiscal policy. In 1898, the Clyde Engineering Works were employing 200 hands, under free-trade, and to-day they employ 700 hands, although they have had to compete with the manufacturers of the whole world. It is all very well to say that the company started in 1898 because they were then assured of federation, but in that year neither New South Wales, Queensland, nor Victoria had decided to federate, and even the "
350,1901-12-11,1,1,0,REPS,8580,0,1901-12-11,"WATKINS, David",KX9,TARIFF,Questions,,,,0,0,- And of importers.

Reference has been made to the fact that the Mort's Dock and Engineering Company purchased a pump in Victoria. At one time they used to import pumpkins from this State, but now we have got down to pumps. We are cutting down our importations, just as the Government are cutting down their Tariff. The Mort's Dock Company, which in 1893, under protection, employed only 700 hands, this year, under freetrade, employed 1,500 hands. How does that fact conform with the statement that free-trade destroys industries "

It is seldom that he does not get up, just when we are coming to a division, and make charges and attacks which demand an answer. I never saw worse assistance given to the passing of a Bill through committee than he is giving to the passing of this Tariff. Surely the right honorable gentleman could take some other opportunity to bitterlyattack those on this side of the Chamber. He accused certain honorable members on this side of misrepresentation, and he could not expect his accusations to go without reply. If this sort of thing goes on, the acting leader of the Opposition will have to consider whether those on this side should not compel the Ministry to sit all night in order to get on with their business. Is the policy of the Commonwealth to depend upon the success or non-success of some particular firm? Are our discussions always to gather round these trifling matters - these mere straws on the surface of the commercial currents of Australia ? Are we to give all the strength of our minds - if we haveany - to theselittle matters, and allow such things to determine the policy of the Commonwealth of Australia? What does it matter to us whether Cameron Bros., of Kapunda, or Hudson Bros., of Sydney, have failed for this cause or that ? As regards Hudson Bros., their failure was not due either to free-trade or protection. They had done well as a firm under free-trade conditions, and made money. But those at the head of it launched into a very large affair, and either through unfortunate circumstances altogether independent of the Tariff, or through mismanagement, the firm drifted to the bad during free -trade years, and to the bad during certain protectionist years, until it finally closed at about the time of the introduction of the Reid Tariff, which was carried at the end of 1895. The exhaustion of capitalin the concern and its misfortunes for a considerable number of years, which may have been due to mismanagement or to over capitalization, were the cause of its failure. "

It was simply the fact that misfortunes followed the . company for years, until finally they had to close up. The Minister produced a telegram, and thought it sufficiently important to occupy our time, although it does not contain a word that was not admitted by honorable members on this side of the chamber. At any rate, there was no statement  made  by honorable members on this side contrary to anything contained in that telegram. What does the telegram say? It states that Hudson Brothers closed in 1896, after the passing of the Reid Tariff. "

We are asked to impose duties to the amount of £355,000 per annum for the purpose of maintaining this industry, and I would remind honorable members that such a sum would permit us to give from 4,500 to 5,000 men amounts equivalent to the wages that they are now receiving.

It is a very grave question whether, after honorable members had paired on the 15 per cent, duty, we should take a vote on another proposal. The difference between a 15 per cent, duty and a 7£ per cent, duty is very considerable, but in. view of the statement made by the acting leader of the Opposition I shall not pursue that point at the present time. A very long discussion might ensue on the question whether we should impose on-the farmers extra taxation to the amount of £75,000, especially when we learn that the money is to go into the pockets of five manufacturers. After this division is taken, I think it will be high time for the committee to report progress. "

If the committee were fit to take a division on whether this line should be free of duty, and to take a division on the question of whether the duty should be 7½ per cent., honorable members ought to be quite fit to divide on the question whether the duty should be 10 per cent. It is no answer to say that some honorable members have gone away. If honorable members go away without asking what the intent or desires of parties are - the acting leader of the Opposition, on the one side, and I on the other, cannot help that - it does not bind the Government, or warrant the honorable member in preventing a division' being taken on a question which has been the subject of two days' debate. This question was discussed yesterday, and has been discussed for nine hours to-day ; and it would be absurd to say that the matter of the rate of the duty has not been dealt with in the course of the debate, or that everyone does not know what rate of duty he prefers. All that is required now is that honorable membersshould express their opinion by vote, unless, of course, the matter has not been adequately debated.

That is an argument which I do not wish to press upon my honorable friend, except in so far that it shows that there is no time like the present. The proper time to take a division is when the committee has debated a matter and has thoroughly thrashed it out. This matter has emphatically been thrashed out, and though there maybe a dozen honorable members who have not yet spoken upon it, the arguments upon the question may still have been thrashed out. The limit of common sense in parliamentary proceedings is reached when debate has been adequate, and that is the time for a division. We have reached the point of adequate debate, and what difficulty is now raised against a division following? I do not wish to urge business unduly, nor do I wish to go beyond this vote. After two days' debate upon this matter, without any charge of obstruction, surely it is time now to divide, unless there is to be a principle laid down that after full time has been spent in adequately discussing a question, the decision upon it is to be put off? I am quite sure I can appeal to my honorable friends opposite to say that as an assembly we have gone into this matter fully. Where there is no obstruction it does not matter whether one side has spoken more than another. I am not going to condemn the Opposition in cases where they have spoken a little more, and where there has been no obstruction. One side will always speak a little more upon a question than the other, and that is no reason why there should be any recrimination amongst us. The question is whether there has not been sufficient debate, and no reasonable man will say that there has not been reasonable debate upon this matter. Thatbeingso, whynotgotoadivision? We should decide this one matter to-night, and then I shall be satisfied to adjourn. "

Complications have already arisen in connexion with our Customs. Other complications may arise in connexion with Customs matters at any moment in any part of Australia. It is of the highest importance, therefore - and the matter is so regarded by commercial people - that the question of the establishment of a High Court should be decided at an early date.
